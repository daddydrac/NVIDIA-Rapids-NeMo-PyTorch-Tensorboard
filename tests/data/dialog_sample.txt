Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.	Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.	Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.	Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?	Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---	Cameron.
Cameron.	The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.	Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why?	Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.	That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...	Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head	Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.	I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.	That's because it's such a nice one.
That's because it's such a nice one.	Forget French.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?	Well, there's someone I think might be --
There.	Where?
You got something on your mind?	I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word.  As a gentleman	You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?	Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.	I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.	I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a...	Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.	So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?	Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.	Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?	I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?	Tons
"I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be ""occupied""."	I was?
I was?	You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...	Then that's all you had to say.
Then that's all you had to say.	But
But	You always been this selfish?
"Then Guillermo says, ""If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."""	No...
do you listen to this crap?	What crap?
What crap?	Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.	Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.	What good stuff?
What good stuff?	"The ""real you""."
"The ""real you""."	Like my fear of wearing pastels?
"I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this ""persona""?  And you don't know how to quit?"	No
No	Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow	Let's go.
She okay?	I hope so.
They do to!	They do not!
Did you change your hair?	No.
No.	You might wanna think about it
Where did he go?  He was just here.	Who?
Who?	Joey.
Great	Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.	Is he oily or dry?
Is he oily or dry?	Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.	Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?	All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.	I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?	I did.
It's more	Expensive?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?	Hopefully.
"So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig "" that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week."	Queen Harry?
Queen Harry?	It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat...	My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.	Hi, Joey.
Hi, Joey.	You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.	You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Where've you been?	Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.	Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?	It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.	Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?	What do you think?
What do you think?	I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.	What's normal?
What's normal?	Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?	At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.	It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?	Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced.	Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --	I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.	You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.	Like you care.
Like you care.	I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .	I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?	What?
What?	In 9th.  For a month
In 9th.  For a month	Why?
Why?	He was, like, a total babe
He was, like, a total babe	But you hate Joey
But you hate Joey	Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.	As in...
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.	You did what?
You did what?	Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
But	"After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"
"After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"	Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?	I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.	No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not	I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.	I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.	God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself	Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.	I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.	So did you
Let go!	You set me up.
You set me up.	I just wanted --
I just wanted --	What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?	No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?	It's just you.
Patrick -- is that- a.	Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...	No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.	What if she never starts dating?
What if she never starts dating?	Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.	But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.	Exactly my point
Daddy, I --	And where're you going?
And where're you going?	If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.	Otherwise known as an orgy?
Otherwise known as an orgy?	"It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria Steinem"" over there isn't going --"
Daddy, people expect me to be there!	If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God.  It's starting.	It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.	Daddy, no!
Daddy, no!	Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.	Why?
Why?	Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --	The prom?  Kat has a date?
The prom?  Kat has a date?	No, but
No, but	It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?	"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."
"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."	You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.	Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something.	I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.	Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?

So they tell me...	C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So -- which Dakota you from?	North, actually.  How'd you   ?

That I'm used to.	Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That girl -- I --	You burn, you pine, you perish?
You burn, you pine, you perish?	Who is she?
Who is she?	Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it	Why not?
Why not?	I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?	Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.	He always have that shit-eating grin?
He always have that shit-eating grin?	Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You know French?	Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada	Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?	You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?	You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.	That's her?  Bianca's sister?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?	The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.	Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
What about him?	You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it?	He seems like he thrives on danger
He seems like he thrives on danger	No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...	They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?	I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.	Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?	Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?	That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.	I thought you hated those people.
I thought you hated those people.	Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved?	Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.	In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.	Will Bogey get bent?
Will Bogey get bent?	Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one.  She hates smokers	It's a lung cancer issue
It's a lung cancer issue	Her favorite uncle
Her favorite uncle	Dead at forty-one.
He's pretty!	Okay!  I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.	It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.	Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.	The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?	Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.	No, I ' m not.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.	Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.	Yeah -- we'll see.
What've you got for me?	I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
"Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and ""angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion""."	So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.	Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy	It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?	She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl?	Sure
Sure	Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?	I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote	She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?	She kissed me.
She kissed me.	Where?
What's the worst?	You get the girl.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?	Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.	They're running the rest of me next month.
Hey -- do you mind?	Not at all
Where ya goin?	Away.
Away.	Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.	And why would I do that?

Two legs, nice rack...	Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.	Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.	You just said
You just said	You need money to take a girl out
You need money to take a girl out	But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.	You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?	I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.	How much?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.	Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.	Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.	I'm on it
I'm on it	Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.	I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price	What?
What?	A hundred bucks a date.
A hundred bucks a date.	Forget it.
Forget it.	Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.	A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?	Do what?
Do what?	Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --	Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey.	Are you lost?
Are you lost?	Nope - just came by to chat
Nope - just came by to chat	We don't chat.
We don't chat.	Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.	We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?	Does this conversation have a purpose?
Does this conversation have a purpose?	So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.	Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*	You and Verona?

He always look so	Block E?
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.	Just a little.
What's this?	An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.	But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.	You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.	William would never have gone to a state school.
William would never have gone to a state school.	William didn't even go to high school

I didn't have a choice.	You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?	I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.	You didn't
You didn't	I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?	Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .	Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.

Busy	Were you in jail?
Were you in jail?	Maybe.
Maybe.	No, you weren't
No, you weren't	Then why'd you ask?

He just wants me to be someone I'm not.	Who?
Who?	BIANCA
BIANCA	No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.	What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?	I heard there was a poetry reading.

Yeah, well, don't let it get out	So what's your excuse?

You know what I mean	No.
No.	No what?
No what?	No, I won't go with you
No, I won't go with you	Why not?
Why not?	Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?	So I have to have a motive to be with you?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?	You tell me.
You tell me.	You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?	Answer the question, Patrick
Answer the question, Patrick	Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?	It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?	It's just something I had.  You know
It's just something I had.  You know	Oh huh
Oh huh	Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
My grandmother's .	What?
What?	That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
That ' s completely adorable!	It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Wait I...	You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!	It wasn't like that.
It wasn't like that.	Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?	I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?	I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.	Is that right?
Is that right?	Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?	Because I like to torture you.
Because I like to torture you.	Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?

Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?	I thought you were punishing me.
I thought you were punishing me.	Why can't we agree on this?

You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.	I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Was that your sister?	Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.	Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?	No, Daddy.
No, Daddy.	So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?	Parts of it.
Parts of it.	Which parts?
Which parts?	The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.	Bianca did what?
Bianca did what?	What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?	No -- impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.	When I go?
When I go?	Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.	Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.	Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.	I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.	The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Tempestuous?	"No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the term used most often."
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?	Just smack her now.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?	Hi.
Hi.	Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?	Yeah.  I guess.
You think?	Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?	Right.
Right.	Kat a fan, too?
Kat a fan, too?	Yeah...
Say it	What?
What?	Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?	The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.	What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.	Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.	So Dorsey can get the girl?
So Dorsey can get the girl?	Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?	We're your guys.
What?!	Good enough.
"Are you telling me I'm a -  ""non-smoker""?"	Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?	Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.	I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?	No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.	Sweet love, renew thy force!
Sweet love, renew thy force!	Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
I missed you.	It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.	It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.	With the teeth of your zipper?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?	Touch of the flu.
Touch of the flu.	I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?	What's to discuss?
What's to discuss?	You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?	Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're completely demented.	See you next week!
In the microwave.	Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?	Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?	Tumescent!
Tumescent!	You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?	Pirate -- no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.	Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap	Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!	But -- who -- what --?
What just happened?	Your daughters went to the prom.
Your daughters went to the prom.	Did I have anything to say about it?
Did I have anything to say about it?	Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.	That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!	The water's going putrid in the barrels.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.	You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.	With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
He's the devil's child...	We'll all go crazy...
We should have seen land.	We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.	Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?	Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.	Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?	I am, Your Eminence
I am, Your Eminence	Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.	Excellency, you are right.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.	Your life, and that of others!
Your life, and that of others!	If they agree to follow me, yes.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.	Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?	No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?	Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?	Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.	IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...	The Judgment is ours!
The Judgment is ours!	Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?	Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.	On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
You can see for yourself.	What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...	A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I could be gone for years.	I know.
I know.	I haven't given you much of a life.
I haven't given you much of a life.	Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...	Are we going to argue?
Are we going to argue?	I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...	I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.	Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.	I don't want you to wait for me.
I don't want you to wait for me.	That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.	You don't usually ask.
You don't usually ask.	I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...	They tried... but I didn't let them.
They took everything...	Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Can't you stay with us a little?	I am busy inside.
What is it, now?  Tell me...	I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?	Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.	May I ask by whom?
May I ask by whom?	Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.	Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment.	Appointment to what?
Appointment to what?	Viceroy of the West Indies.
Viceroy of the West Indies.	Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
How far from here?	I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.	How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.	I am afraid this is not the worst news.
I want to go with you!	There'll be a time.
There'll be a time.	You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?	Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.	This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?	Not bad.
Father...	There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?	I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?	He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.	He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.	Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...	Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No...	No?
No?	NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.	I'm not bargaining!
I'm not bargaining!	Then you are too ambitious.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?	If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...	Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
You defend yourself admirably...	... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.	Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.	Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.	What...?  Do I have so many already?
What...?  Do I have so many already?	To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
All I have to do is call the guards.	Call them.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.	Look out of that window.
What do you see?	Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...	All of them created by people like me.
Say not here!  Cuba!	What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?	Island.  Far.
You come!  You speak first!	Tell the Chief we thank him.
Tell the Chief we thank him.	Chief knows.
Chief knows.	Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief says -- how many?	Thousands.
Thousands.	Why?
To bring the word of God.	Chief says -- he has a God.
Chief says -- he has a God.	... and also to bring medicine.
... and also to bring medicine.	Chief says...
Chief says...	He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?	He understands.
He understands.	Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!	You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.	You never learned how to speak my language.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...	Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
God... That's in a week!	That's what it says.
That's what it says.	How did you manage it?
How did you manage it?	With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Why do you wish to sail west?	To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.	Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.	How can you be so certain?
How can you be so certain?	The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...	Esdras is a Jew.
Esdras is a Jew.	So was Christ!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.	I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...	Father Marchena!
Father Marchena!	Passion is something one cannot control!
Passion is something one cannot control!	You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!	I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!	Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.	Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?	If God intends you to go, then you will go.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.	Damn God!
Colon!	Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
All of them!  Just lies!	Colon!  Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.	Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son.	Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.	How long?
How long?	I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!	If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...	My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.	You are bound by an oath, Father.
I believed in you...	Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now.	You'll always be older than me, Father.
I have to disagree.	I knew you would.
I knew you would.	New worlds create new people.
New worlds create new people.	Oh?  So you are a new man?
Oh?  So you are a new man?	I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.	No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
The ocean is uncrossable?	What did they say about Granada before today?
What did they say about Granada before today?	That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.	Surely you can do anything you want.
May I speak freely?	You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!	"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."
"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."	A woman?
How old are you, Senor Colon?	Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?	They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.	Thank you.
Thank you.	There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?	Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.	The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.	If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?	We don't need to know.
We don't need to know.	We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We can't raise the wheel without it.	My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.	You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!	Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.	You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?	You will regret this.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...	God be with us admiral.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...	And what do you think Mendez?
And what do you think Mendez?	Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.	Come over here.
What do you read?	Twenty eight.
What's he doing?	He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.	We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?	Immediately.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!	Six days ago, yes.
Six days ago, yes.	You must be mad...!
You must be mad...!	We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!	We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!	You think I don't know that?
You think I don't know that?	We're lost!
We're lost!	The land is there.  I know it!
The land is there.  I know it!	You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!	And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!	Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!	You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?	You bloody...
You bloody...	Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!	You tell that to them!
You tell that to them!	You're right.  Let the men decide.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?	Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.	Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
... Into a monk...	Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.	We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...	Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?	He must be replaced.
He must be replaced.	And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.	Then why?
Then why?	Because he is not afraid of me.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.	I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.	Here.  I have your money.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!	Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?	He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Don't say anything.	Where are we going?
Where are we going?	I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.	Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!	I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.	You bring the cigarettes?
You bring the cigarettes?	Oh, sure.
...delusions and paranoia.	I was all of these.
I was all of these.	Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.	What about Oleg?
What about Oleg?	Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.	No, he is here.  Shit...
No, he is here.  Shit...	Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.	What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?	Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.	What's your cut?  How much?
What's your cut?  How much?	I would say...half.  Half is fair.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.	No.  No way.
No.  No way.	But it's...
But it's...	Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.	This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.	What else do you need?
What else do you need?	I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.	Give me another one, please.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.	My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.	Your mother was blind?
Your mother was blind?	Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.	Back in the Czech Republic?
Back in the Czech Republic?	Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...	Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?	Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.	Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?	Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.	Can I see your back?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?	I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...	Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.	Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.	Yes, but he was a cop.
Now I become custody of police department?	If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.	I will if they don't send me back.
I will if they don't send me back.	They won't until this is over.
Are you married?	Divorced.
Divorced.	Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
I can't take you to my place.	Somewhere else?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.	So...the station is empty?
So...the station is empty?	Yeah.  This way.
You considered becoming a prostitute?	Yes, I considered it.
Yes, I considered it.	Did you ever turn tricks before?
Did you ever turn tricks before?	No.
No.	What about back home?
What about back home?	No.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.	So you were never a prostitute?
So you were never a prostitute?	What are you asking me?
What are you asking me?	I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.	I know.
I know.	You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?	They're not gonna send you right back.
They're not gonna send you right back.	I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
Are you alright?	I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.	I'm sorry.
Is he your boyfriend?	Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?	If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.	If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.	No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.	I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.	Right.
Do you have coffee?	In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.	I'll make some for us.
I'll make some for us.	I'll get my clothes.
What are you doing?	Pouring it out!
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.	...Do you really want me to forget about you?
...Do you really want me to forget about you?	I don't want to drag you down with me.
I don't want to drag you down with me.	Daphne, I...
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.	C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?	Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.	Go on.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.	If I tell you, will you arrest me?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?	Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.	No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
A cop?	I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.	Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?	You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Oh.	It was my decision, not his.
It was my decision, not his.	Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.	Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.	Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.	I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.	Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who did cause and origin?	Who do you think, Chief?!
Who do you think, Chief?!	Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?	'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?	I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.	What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'	I let her take a shower.
I let her take a shower.	A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?	No!  Nothing happened.
No!  Nothing happened.	Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Chief - mind if I take her?	Okay.  But not water sports.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!	What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.	Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!	Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.	Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.	End my career?
End my career?	How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.	But Chief?  Over this??
But Chief?  Over this??	There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.	Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.	What was that, Korfin?
What was that, Korfin?	I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.	You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?	Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.	Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?	Yeah.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.	Vodka tonic.
Vodka tonic.	Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.	What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
I'm gonna propose.	When?
When?	Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.	You ready?
What's he looking for?	A timer.
Where is she?	Takin' a bath.
Takin' a bath.	Any I.D.?
Any I.D.?	Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Sorry...PD only.	It's okay.
Only one guys checked in?	Yeah.
Yeah.	C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.	Stay with her.
Are you hit?	No.  I'm okay.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!	I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Who's there?	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.	I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...	Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
What's wrong?	We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.	Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...	Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?	No.
No.	Did you tell him you did?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.	What are you saying?
What are you saying?	Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.	Describe him.
Describe him.	Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.	He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!	She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.	No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
You know what that is, right?	No, what is it?
No, what is it?	Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.	Watch the news?
Watch the news?	Nah, I musta missed it.
Nah, I musta missed it.	Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.	Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.	Nah, why should you?
Nah, why should you?	I don't even watch TV.
I don't even watch TV.	Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?	Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?	If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?	You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.	Pretty.
Pretty.	Hmmmm.
Hmmmm.	Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.	Who says she's a suspect?
What would you call her?	Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.	Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?	Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
I'll come with you.	There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.	I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.	This isn't homicide school.
This isn't homicide school.	My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.	You're Polish?
You're Polish?	My folks are.
My folks are.	Stay here.
You goin' to the escort service?	You got any better ideas?
You got any better ideas?	Mind if I ride along with you?
Mind if I ride along with you?	This has nothing to do with your fire.
This has nothing to do with your fire.	But what if it does?  You might need my help.
I'll let you know what happens.	This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.	Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.	I'll call it... tails.
Two heads.	Better than one.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.	I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
You thirsty?	I'm on duty.
I'm on duty.	So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.	Of course.
Of course.	Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?	I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.	Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid	She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.	Is that all there is?
Why not?	Something back home?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.	Raw deal.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.	You wanna talk to her alone?
You wanna talk to her alone?	Yeah.
Yeah.	What would your girlfriend think of that?
What would your girlfriend think of that?	I don't have a girlfriend.
I don't have a girlfriend.	My point exactly.
My point exactly.	I'm serious here.
I'm serious here.	So am I.
So am I.	C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.	You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?	You know what I'm saying here.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.	Hey.  I'm a professional.
Hey.  I'm a professional.	Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.	Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.	I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.	Just a shower?
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...	No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.	I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.	Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.	But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.	How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
