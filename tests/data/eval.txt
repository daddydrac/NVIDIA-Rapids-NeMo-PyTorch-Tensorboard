Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.    Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.    Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.    Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?    Forget it.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---    Cameron.
Cameron.    The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.    Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Why?    Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.    That's a shame.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...    Let me see what I can do.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head    Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.    I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.    That's because it's such a nice one.
That's because it's such a nice one.    Forget French.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?    Well, there's someone I think might be --
There.    Where?
You got something on your mind?    I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You have my word.  As a gentleman    You're sweet.
How do you get your hair to look like that?    Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
Sure have.    I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.    I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
She's not a...    Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.    So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?    Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Hi.    Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
You know Chastity?    I believe we share an art instructor
Have fun tonight?    Tons
"I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be ""occupied""."    I was?
I was?    You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Well, no...    Then that's all you had to say.
Then that's all you had to say.    But
But    You always been this selfish?
"Then Guillermo says, ""If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."""    No...
do you listen to this crap?    What crap?
What crap?    Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.    Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.    What good stuff?
What good stuff?    "The ""real you""."
"The ""real you""."    Like my fear of wearing pastels?
"I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this ""persona""?  And you don't know how to quit?"    No
No    Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Wow    Let's go.
She okay?    I hope so.
They do to!    They do not!
Did you change your hair?    No.
No.    You might wanna think about it
Where did he go?  He was just here.    Who?
Who?    Joey.
Great    Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.    Is he oily or dry?
Is he oily or dry?    Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.    Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?    All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.    I don't have to be home 'til two.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?    I did.
It's more    Expensive?
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?    Hopefully.
"So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig "" that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week."    Queen Harry?
Queen Harry?    It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Neat...    My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hey, sweet cheeks.    Hi, Joey.
Hi, Joey.    You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.    You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Where've you been?    Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.    Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?    It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.    Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?    What do you think?
What do you think?    I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.    What's normal?
What's normal?    Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?    At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.    It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?    Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You are so completely unbalanced.    Can we go now?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --    I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.    You're welcome.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.    Like you care.
Like you care.    I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .    I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?    What?
What?    In 9th.  For a month
In 9th.  For a month    Why?
Why?    He was, like, a total babe
He was, like, a total babe    But you hate Joey
But you hate Joey    Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.    As in...
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.    You did what?
You did what?    Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
But    "After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"
"After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because ""everyone else"" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --"    Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?    I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.    No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
That's not    I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.    I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.    God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself    Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.    I guess I'll never know, will I?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.    So did you
Let go!    You set me up.
You set me up.    I just wanted --
I just wanted --    What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?    No! I just wanted
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?    It's just you.
Patrick -- is that- a.    Perm?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...    No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.    What if she never starts dating?
What if she never starts dating?    Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.    But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
But she doesn't want to date.    Exactly my point
Daddy, I --    And where're you going?
And where're you going?    If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.    Otherwise known as an orgy?
Otherwise known as an orgy?    "It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria Steinem"" over there isn't going --"
Daddy, people expect me to be there!    If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Oh, God.  It's starting.    It's just a party. Daddy.
Wear the belly before you go.    Daddy, no!
Daddy, no!    Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.    Why?
Why?    Because she'll scare them away.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --    The prom?  Kat has a date?
The prom?  Kat has a date?    No, but
No, but    It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?    "He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."
"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is."    You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.    Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I'm missing something.    I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.    Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?    Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?    Never
Never    Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?    Just sent 'em through.
You the new guy?    So they tell me...
So they tell me...    C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So -- which Dakota you from?    North, actually.  How'd you   ?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?    I was kidding. People actually live there?
I was kidding. People actually live there?    Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.    How many people were in your old school?
How many people were in your old school?    Thirty-two.
Thirty-two.    Get out!
Get out!    How many people go here?
How many people go here?    Couple thousand. Most of them evil
That I'm used to.    Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That girl -- I --    You burn, you pine, you perish?
You burn, you pine, you perish?    Who is she?
Who is she?    Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it    Why not?
Why not?    I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?    Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.    He always have that shit-eating grin?
He always have that shit-eating grin?    Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
You know French?    Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada    Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?    You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?    You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.    That's her?  Bianca's sister?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?    The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.    Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
What about him?    You wanna go out with him?
What makes you think he'll do it?    He seems like he thrives on danger
He seems like he thrives on danger    No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...    They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?    I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.    Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?    Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?    That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.    I thought you hated those people.
I thought you hated those people.    Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
You got him involved?    Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.    In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.    Will Bogey get bent?
Will Bogey get bent?    Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Number one.  She hates smokers    It's a lung cancer issue
It's a lung cancer issue    Her favorite uncle
Her favorite uncle    Dead at forty-one.
He's pretty!    Okay!  I wasn't sure
Assail your ears for one night.    It's her favorite band.
You told me that part already.    Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.    The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?    Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.    No, I ' m not.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.    Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.    Yeah -- we'll see.
What've you got for me?    I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
"Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and ""angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion""."    So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.    Don't make me do it, man
Cameron, I'm a little busy    It's off. The whole thing.
What 're you talking about?    She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl?    Sure
Sure    Then, go get her
What'd you do to her?    I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote    She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You makin' any headway?    She kissed me.
She kissed me.    Where?
What's the worst?    You get the girl.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?    Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.    They're running the rest of me next month.
Hey -- do you mind?    Not at all
Where ya goin?    Away.
Away.    Your sister here?
Leave my sister alone.    And why would I do that?
Yeah    What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...    Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.    Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.    You just said
You just said    You need money to take a girl out
You need money to take a girl out    But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.    You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?    I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.    How much?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.    Fine, thirty.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.    Fifty, and you've got your man.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.    I'm on it
I'm on it    Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.    I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
I just upped my price    What?
What?    A hundred bucks a date.
A hundred bucks a date.    Forget it.
Forget it.    Forget her sister, then.
It's about time.    A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?    Do what?
Do what?    Get her to act like a human
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --    Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Hey.    Are you lost?
Are you lost?    Nope - just came by to chat
Nope - just came by to chat    We don't chat.
We don't chat.    Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.    We're not.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?    Does this conversation have a purpose?
Does this conversation have a purpose?    So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
I hear you're helpin' Verona.    Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*    You and Verona?
You and Verona?    What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.    Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Who's that?    Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.    That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.    I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.    He always look so
He always look so    Block E?
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.    Just a little.
What's this?    An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.    But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.    You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.    William would never have gone to a state school.
William would never have gone to a state school.    William didn't even go to high school
William didn't even go to high school    That's never been proven
That's never been proven    Neither has his heterosexuality.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?    Does it matter?
Does it matter?    "If I was Bianca, it would be, ""Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."""
You think this'll work?    No fear.
What'd he say?    Who cares?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.    I didn't have a choice.
I didn't have a choice.    You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?    I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.    You didn't
You didn't    I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?    Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .    Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.    Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway    You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.    Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Have you seen him?    Who?
Who?    William - he asked me to meet him here.
William - he asked me to meet him here.    Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?    Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?    There's a way to get a guy's attention.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.    My mission in life.
Pick you up Friday, then    Oh, right.  Friday.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.    Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?    I know a lot more than that
You hate me don't you?    I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.    Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.    And why would I do that?
And why would I do that?    Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...    You -- covered in my vomit.
You -- covered in my vomit.    Seven-thirty?
Are you following me?    I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.    Hi
You're not a big talker, are you?    Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
Excuse me?    That's what you want, isn't it?
That's what you want, isn't it?    Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.    You know who The Raincoats are?
You know who The Raincoats are?    Why, don't you?
What's this?    """I'm getting trashed, man."" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?"
"""I'm getting trashed, man."" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?"    I say, do what you wanna do.
I say, do what you wanna do.    Funny, you're the only one
Okay?    I'm fine. I'm
You're not okay.    I just need to lie down for awhile
I just need to lie down for awhile    Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep    I know, just let me sleep
I know, just let me sleep    What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
This is so patronizing.    Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.    Why 're you doing this?
Why 're you doing this?    I told you
I told you    You don't care if I die
You don't care if I die    Sure, I do
Sure, I do    Why?
Why?    Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.    Like you could find one
Like you could find one    See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?    Just let me sit down.
Why'd you let him get to you?    Who?
Who?    Dorsey.
Dorsey.    I hate him.
I hate him.    I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.    "Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?"
"Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be ""cool""?  You don't think I can be ""laid back"" like everyone else?"    I thought you were above all that
I thought you were above all that    You know what they say
Kat! Wake up!    What?
And I'm in control of it.    But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?    Busy
Busy    Were you in jail?
Were you in jail?    Maybe.
Maybe.    No, you weren't
No, you weren't    Then why'd you ask?
Then why'd you ask?    Why'd you lie?
I should do this.    Do what?
Do what?    This.
Start a band?    My father wouldn't approve of that that
My father wouldn't approve of that that    You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Oh, so now you think you know me?    I'm gettin' there
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?    He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.    Who?
Who?    BIANCA
BIANCA    No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.    What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?    I heard there was a poetry reading.
I heard there was a poetry reading.    You 're so --
You 're so --    Pleasant?
Wholesome.    Unwelcome.
Unwelcome.    Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.    Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.    So what did I have an effect on ?
So what did I have an effect on ?    Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.    Look up, sunshine
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.    C'mon.  It's not that bad
C'mon.  It's not that bad    Try lookin' at it from this angle
Put your right foot there --    Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.    You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?    Maybe.
The Partridge Family?    I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.    Good call.
Good call.    So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?    I dazzled him with my wit
A soft side? Who knew?    Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Yeah, well, don't let it get out    So what's your excuse?
So what's your excuse?    Acting the way we do.
Acting the way we do.    Yes
Yes    I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.    So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?    Something like that
Something like that    Then you screwed up
Then you screwed up    How?
How?    You never disappointed me.
You up for it?    For. . . ?
State trooper?    Fallacy.
Fallacy.    The duck?
The duck?    Hearsay.
Hearsay.    I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.    I hate peas.
I hate peas.    No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.    You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.    What?
What?    No one else knows
No one else knows    You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?    Go to the prom with me
Is that a request or a command?    You know what I mean
You know what I mean    No.
No.    No what?
No what?    No, I won't go with you
No, I won't go with you    Why not?
Why not?    Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?    So I have to have a motive to be with you?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?    You tell me.
You tell me.    You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?    Answer the question, Patrick
Answer the question, Patrick    Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?    It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?    It's just something I had.  You know
It's just something I had.  You know    Oh huh
Oh huh    Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
My grandmother's .    What?
What?    That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
That ' s completely adorable!    It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Wait I...    You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!    It wasn't like that.
It wasn't like that.    Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?    I didn't care about the money.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?    I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.    Is that right?
Is that right?    Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?    Because I like to torture you.
Because I like to torture you.    Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?    Don ' t you even dare. . .
I know.    I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.    You decided.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?    Enough!
My insurance does not cover PMS    Then tell them I had a seizure.
Then tell them I had a seizure.    Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?    I thought you were punishing me.
I thought you were punishing me.    Why can't we agree on this?
Why can't we agree on this?    Because you're making decisions for me.
Because you're making decisions for me.    As a parent, that's my right
As a parent, that's my right    So what I want doesn't matter?
So what I want doesn't matter?    You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.    I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Was that your sister?    Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.    Funny.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?    No, Daddy.
No, Daddy.    So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?    Parts of it.
Parts of it.    Which parts?
Which parts?    The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.    Bianca did what?
Bianca did what?    What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?    No -- impressed.
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.    When I go?
When I go?    Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.    Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.    Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.    I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.    The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Tempestuous?    "No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the term used most often."
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?    Just smack her now.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?    Hi.
Hi.    Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?    Yeah.  I guess.
You think?    Oh yeah.
Macbeth, right?    Right.
Right.    Kat a fan, too?
Kat a fan, too?    Yeah...
Say it    What?
What?    Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What plan?    The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.    What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.    Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.    So Dorsey can get the girl?
So Dorsey can get the girl?    Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?    We're your guys.
What?!    Good enough.
"Are you telling me I'm a -  ""non-smoker""?"    Just for now.
Ever been to Club Skunk?    Yeah.
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.    I'm likin' you guys better
So you got cozy with she who stings?    No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
You were right. She's still pissed.    Sweet love, renew thy force!
Sweet love, renew thy force!    Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
I missed you.    It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.    With the teeth of your zipper?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?    Touch of the flu.
Touch of the flu.    I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?    What's to discuss?
What's to discuss?    You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?    Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You're completely demented.    See you next week!
In the microwave.    Make anyone cry today?
What's a synonym for throbbing?    Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?    Tumescent!
Tumescent!    You're not helping.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?    Pirate -- no question.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.    Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap    Dr. Ruth?
Have a great time, honey!    But -- who -- what --?
What just happened?    Your daughters went to the prom.
Your daughters went to the prom.    Did I have anything to say about it?
Did I have anything to say about it?    Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.    That ' s what I thought
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!    The water's going putrid in the barrels.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.    You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
What are you listening to, chicken ass?    Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.    With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
He's the devil's child...    We'll all go crazy...
We should have seen land.    We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.    Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?    Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.    Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?    I am, Your Eminence
I am, Your Eminence    Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.    Excellency, you are right.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.    Your life, and that of others!
Your life, and that of others!    If they agree to follow me, yes.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.    Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?    No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?    Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?    Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.    IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...    The Judgment is ours!
The Judgment is ours!    Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?    Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.    On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
You can see for yourself.    What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...    A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I could be gone for years.    I know.
I know.    I haven't given you much of a life.
I haven't given you much of a life.    Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...    Are we going to argue?
Are we going to argue?    I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...    I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.    Thank God...
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.    I don't want you to wait for me.
I don't want you to wait for me.    That's something you can't decide.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.    You don't usually ask.
You don't usually ask.    I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...    They tried... but I didn't let them.
They took everything...    Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
Can't you stay with us a little?    I am busy inside.
What is it, now?  Tell me...    I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?    Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.    May I ask by whom?
May I ask by whom?    Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.    Yes... I remember...
My letters of appointment.    Appointment to what?
Appointment to what?    Viceroy of the West Indies.
Viceroy of the West Indies.    Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
How far from here?    I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.    How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.    I am afraid this is not the worst news.
I want to go with you!    There'll be a time.
There'll be a time.    You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?    Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
I have to explore the mainland.    This time with me!
How are you feeling, Fernando?    Not bad.
Father...    There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What are you listening to?    I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
What does he say?    He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.    He never had one... except aboard my ships!
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.    Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...    Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No...    No?
No?    NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.    I'm not bargaining!
I'm not bargaining!    Then you are too ambitious.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?    If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...    Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
You defend yourself admirably...    ... for a commoner?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.    Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.    Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.    What...?  Do I have so many already?
What...?  Do I have so many already?    To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
All I have to do is call the guards.    Call them.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.    Look out of that window.
What do you see?    Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...    All of them created by people like me.
Say not here!  Cuba!    What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?    Island.  Far.
You come!  You speak first!    Tell the Chief we thank him.
Tell the Chief we thank him.    Chief knows.
Chief knows.    Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Chief says -- how many?    Thousands.
Thousands.    Why?
To bring the word of God.    Chief says -- he has a God.
Chief says -- he has a God.    ... and also to bring medicine.
... and also to bring medicine.    Chief says...
Chief says...    He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?    He understands.
He understands.    Ask him if he will help.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!    You did the same to your God!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.    You never learned how to speak my language.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...    Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
God... That's in a week!    That's what it says.
That's what it says.    How did you manage it?
How did you manage it?    With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Why do you wish to sail west?    To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.    Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.    How can you be so certain?
How can you be so certain?    The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...    Esdras is a Jew.
Esdras is a Jew.    So was Christ!
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.    I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...    Father Marchena!
Father Marchena!    Passion is something one cannot control!
Passion is something one cannot control!    You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!    I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!    Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.    Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?    If God intends you to go, then you will go.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.    Damn God!
Colon!    Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
All of them!  Just lies!    Colon!  Don't!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.    Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I am listening, my son.    Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.    What are you saying?
What are you saying?    I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.    How long?
How long?    I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!    If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...    My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.    You are bound by an oath, Father.
I believed in you...    Give me absolution.
I suppose we're both old men now.    You'll always be older than me, Father.
I have to disagree.    I knew you would.
I knew you would.    New worlds create new people.
New worlds create new people.    Oh?  So you are a new man?
Oh?  So you are a new man?    I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.    No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
The ocean is uncrossable?    What did they say about Granada before today?
What did they say about Granada before today?    That she was impregnable.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.    Surely you can do anything you want.
May I speak freely?    You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!    "I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."
"I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... ""What if?""..."    A woman?
How old are you, Senor Colon?    Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
Do they have such thoughts?    They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.    Thank you.
Thank you.    There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?    Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.    The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.    If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?    We don't need to know.
We don't need to know.    We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
We can't raise the wheel without it.    My horse doesn't work.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.    You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!    Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.    You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?    You will regret this.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...    God be with us admiral.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...    And what do you think Mendez?
And what do you think Mendez?    Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.    Come over here.
What do you read?    Twenty eight.
What's he doing?    He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.    We can't be.
Where can I meet this man?    Immediately.
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!    Six days ago, yes.
Six days ago, yes.    You must be mad...!
You must be mad...!    We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!    We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!    You think I don't know that?
You think I don't know that?    We're lost!
We're lost!    The land is there.  I know it!
The land is there.  I know it!    You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!    And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!    Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!    You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?    You bloody...
You bloody...    Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!    You tell that to them!
You tell that to them!    You're right.  Let the men decide.
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?    Yes, Your Majesty.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.    Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
... Into a monk...    Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.    We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...    Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?    He must be replaced.
He must be replaced.    And who would you think of, for such a task?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.    Then why?
Then why?    Because he is not afraid of me.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.    I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.    Here.  I have your money.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!    Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?    He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Don't say anything.    Where are we going?
Where are we going?    I'm coming with you.
I'm coming with you.    Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Yes.  Yes, come with me!    I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.    You bring the cigarettes?
You bring the cigarettes?    Oh, sure.
...delusions and paranoia.    I was all of these.
I was all of these.    Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.    What about Oleg?
What about Oleg?    Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.    No, he is here.  Shit...
No, he is here.  Shit...    Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.    What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?    Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.    What's your cut?  How much?
What's your cut?  How much?    I would say...half.  Half is fair.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.    No.  No way.
No.  No way.    But it's...
But it's...    Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.    This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.    What else do you need?
What else do you need?    I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.    Give me another one, please.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.    My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.    Your mother was blind?
Your mother was blind?    Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.    Back in the Czech Republic?
Back in the Czech Republic?    Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...    Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?    Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.    Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?    Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.    Can I see your back?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?    I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...    Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.    Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.    Yes, but he was a cop.
Now I become custody of police department?    If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.    I will if they don't send me back.
I will if they don't send me back.    They won't until this is over.
Are you married?    Divorced.
Divorced.    Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
I can't take you to my place.    Somewhere else?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.    So...the station is empty?
So...the station is empty?    Yeah.  This way.
You considered becoming a prostitute?    Yes, I considered it.
Yes, I considered it.    Did you ever turn tricks before?
Did you ever turn tricks before?    No.
No.    What about back home?
What about back home?    No.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.    So you were never a prostitute?
So you were never a prostitute?    What are you asking me?
What are you asking me?    I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.    I know.
I know.    You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?    They're not gonna send you right back.
They're not gonna send you right back.    I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
Are you alright?    I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.    I'm sorry.
Is he your boyfriend?    Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?    If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.    If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.    No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.    I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.    Right.
Do you have coffee?    In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.    I'll make some for us.
I'll make some for us.    I'll get my clothes.
What are you doing?    Pouring it out!
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.    ...Do you really want me to forget about you?
...Do you really want me to forget about you?    I don't want to drag you down with me.
I don't want to drag you down with me.    Daphne, I...
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.    C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?    Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.    Go on.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.    If I tell you, will you arrest me?
If I tell you, will you arrest me?    Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.    No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
A cop?    I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.    Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?    You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Oh.    It was my decision, not his.
It was my decision, not his.    Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.    Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.    Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.    I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.    Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who did cause and origin?    Who do you think, Chief?!
Who do you think, Chief?!    Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?    'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?    I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.    What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'    I let her take a shower.
I let her take a shower.    A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?    No!  Nothing happened.
No!  Nothing happened.    Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Chief - mind if I take her?    Okay.  But not water sports.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!    What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.    Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!    Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.    Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.    End my career?
End my career?    How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.    But Chief?  Over this??
But Chief?  Over this??    There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.    Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.    What was that, Korfin?
What was that, Korfin?    I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.    You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?    Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.    Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?    Yeah.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.    Vodka tonic.
Vodka tonic.    Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.    What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
I'm gonna propose.    When?
When?    Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.    You ready?
What's he looking for?    A timer.
Where is she?    Takin' a bath.
Takin' a bath.    Any I.D.?
Any I.D.?    Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Sorry...PD only.    It's okay.
Only one guys checked in?    Yeah.
Yeah.    C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.    Stay with her.
Are you hit?    No.  I'm okay.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!    I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Who's there?    Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.    I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...    Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
What's wrong?    We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.    Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...    Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?    No.
No.    Did you tell him you did?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.    What are you saying?
What are you saying?    Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.    Describe him.
Describe him.    Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.    He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!    She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.    No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
You know what that is, right?    No, what is it?
No, what is it?    Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.    Watch the news?
Watch the news?    Nah, I musta missed it.
Nah, I musta missed it.    Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.    Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.    Nah, why should you?
Nah, why should you?    I don't even watch TV.
I don't even watch TV.    Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?    Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?    If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?    You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.    Pretty.
Pretty.    Hmmmm.
Hmmmm.    Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.    Who says she's a suspect?
What would you call her?    Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.    Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?    Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
I'll come with you.    There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.    I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.    This isn't homicide school.
This isn't homicide school.    My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.    You're Polish?
You're Polish?    My folks are.
My folks are.    Stay here.
You goin' to the escort service?    You got any better ideas?
You got any better ideas?    Mind if I ride along with you?
Mind if I ride along with you?    This has nothing to do with your fire.
This has nothing to do with your fire.    But what if it does?  You might need my help.
I'll let you know what happens.    This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.    Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.    I'll call it... tails.
Two heads.    Better than one.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.    I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
You thirsty?    I'm on duty.
I'm on duty.    So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.    Of course.
Of course.    Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?    I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.    Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid    She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.    Is that all there is?
Why not?    Something back home?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.    Raw deal.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.    You wanna talk to her alone?
You wanna talk to her alone?    Yeah.
Yeah.    What would your girlfriend think of that?
What would your girlfriend think of that?    I don't have a girlfriend.
I don't have a girlfriend.    My point exactly.
My point exactly.    I'm serious here.
I'm serious here.    So am I.
So am I.    C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.    You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?    You know what I'm saying here.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.    Hey.  I'm a professional.
Hey.  I'm a professional.    Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.    Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.    I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.    Just a shower?
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...    No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.    I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.    Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.    But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.    How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?    You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
So...who's Nicky?    What do you want?
What do you want?    Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.    What's your accomplishment.
What's your accomplishment.    I kill someone famous.
I kill someone famous.    Then do it, asshole.
Then do it, asshole.    Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.    If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?    Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
Detective, does it look like a murder?    We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.    How many victims are up there?
How many victims are up there?    There are two bodies found at this point.
There are two bodies found at this point.    Can we go up to the crime scene?

You know you can't do that.  C'mon.    Is it drug related?
Is it drug related?    We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?    I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?    I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.    Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?    He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.    Do you have the suspect in custody?
Do you have the suspect in custody?    Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.    Alright, cut, cut, cut.

Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...    Stop it.
Stop it.    Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?    Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.    I'm not.
I'm not.    Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.    Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...    That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.    You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.    Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?    You're ruthless.
You're ruthless.    You're not so bad yourself.

So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.    Jesus Christ.
Sooner or later that's everybody.    Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.

Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?

Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!    Don't speak Russian!
Don't speak Russian!    Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?    Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.    We have no money.  Come on.

Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.    For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
What?    Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
Turn that fucking thing off!    I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
Speak English!    You said speak Czech!
You said speak Czech!    How you erase this?
How you erase this?    I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Whore?    I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Get in the bathroom!    Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?    Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.    Shut up.
Shut up.    Does it hurt?
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!    Don't want to film this?
What is it?    The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.    I did.

And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.    Why not?
Why not?    Put the camera down, Oleg.
What is that?    What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Let me get a shot of it.    Sit down!
Sit down!    This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!    Good idea!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!    Cut!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?    Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?    The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
I'm serious.    Shut up.  Look!
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'    Bad last moment - I cut it out.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!    Be quiet.  Watch.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?    Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.    Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.    Credit?
Credit?    Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.    Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
You got that?    No, I don't get that!
No, I don't get that!    You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
Traitor!!    No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Emil???!    Surprise!  Surprise!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.    Did you hurt her?
Did you hurt her?    You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!    Milos.  Get my money!
We spent it!    Ha. Ha.
Ha. Ha.    Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
I can get you a job.    A job?
A job?    Yes, the money is good.
Yes, the money is good.    As a plumber?!
As a plumber?!    It's easy to learn.
It's easy to learn.    A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!    We started over, you can too.
We started over, you can too.    You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
Robert...?    What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?    You've got a call.
You've got a call.    I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.    Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
Viewer discretion advised!    You want the tape?  There it is!
Isn't he a little moody?    Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.    In love?  With who?
Yeah?    Paulie, you've got kids, right?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!    This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.    If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!    Don't give me that fucking shit.
I know.    What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?    Well, he...
Well, he...    I want to hear everything he said.
I want to hear everything he said.    I'm trying to tell you.
I'm trying to tell you.    Alright.  Go ahead.
Alright.  Go ahead.    That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.    Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Yes...he's my friend.    Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
I speak English.    Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?    New York.
New York.    Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?    A cheap hotel.
A cheap hotel.    What are you coming here to do?
What are you coming here to do?    I'm here for movies.
I'm here for movies.    Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?    "Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called ""It's a Wonderful Life"" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white."
"Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called ""It's a Wonderful Life"" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white."    Excuse me?
No.  Go ahead.    Thanks.  Appreciate it.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?    That's what it looks like to me.
That's what it looks like to me.    And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.    Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
What was that?    Evidence.  Of a homicide.
I'll take him.    No way!  He's mine!
No way!  He's mine!    We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!    He's my collar!
He's my collar!    Well, he killed my partner!
Well, he killed my partner!    He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?    Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!    Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?    Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.    Oh yeah?  Guess again.
I'll send a cop back for you.    Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
You okay?    A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!    Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.    Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?    How did you start the fire this time?
How did you start the fire this time?    I used an accelerant.
I used an accelerant.    Yeah?  What kind?
Yeah?  What kind?    Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!    I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?    I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?    You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?    Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.    Oh yeah, why?
Oh yeah, why?    'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.    Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Mouth's clean, too.    Clean?
Clean?    Don't blow your nose!
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.    But you knew that, right?
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.    He knew all along.
He knew all along.    What??
What??    That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
What?    There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.    Yeah?
Yeah?    Maybe you can be his stand-in.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.    How long they been livin' here?
How long they been livin' here?    You hear that question, Garcia?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.    Aren't you tired?
Aren't you tired?    If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!    It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!    Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
How was it?    Not good.
Get outta here!    What the hell happened?
What the hell happened?    They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.    Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?    The clerk?
What are you gonna do?    Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.    Don't stoop to his level!
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.    Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.    GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.    Your doctor?
Your doctor?    Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.    ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?    It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.    You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.    Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?    Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?

But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?    That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE    Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
CONTINUED    I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
CONTINUED    She's wonderful.
CONTINUED    Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
CONTINUED    How did they manage to do that without any communication?
CONTINUED    I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
CONTINUED    We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.    Right. Just a sec.
Right. Just a sec.    Okay.
Okay.    Okay, come on down.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.    Sure, what is it?
Sure, what is it?    Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.    What's up?
What's up?    It's about my salary cheques.
It's about my salary cheques.    Yes?
Yes?    Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.    Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.    Really.
Really.    Yes.
Yes.    Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.    It's possible.
It's possible.    Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?    I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.    I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.    No. I never did, either.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.    I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.    Oh?
Oh?    Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.    No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.    Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.    That seems very unlikely.
That seems very unlikely.    Yes, I thought so.
Yes, I thought so.    Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.    How?
How?    Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.    That's true.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.    Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.    I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.    But not completely inconceivable?
But not completely inconceivable?    I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.    I guess it isn't.
I guess it isn't.    Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Well, that's something.    Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.    I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.    Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.    Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Good morning. How's it going?    Are you reasonably awake?
Are you reasonably awake?    Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?    Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.    You're kidding.
You're kidding.    No.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.    Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?    Two more.
Two more.    Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Hal?    Yes.
It's the last one.    Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.    I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.    I guess not.
I guess not.    I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.    Roger.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.    He's got a point.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.    What is it, Hal?
What is it, Hal?    MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.    I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.    Sure, Dave, what's up?
Sure, Dave, what's up?    You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?    Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.    You probably also know that we found them okay.
You probably also know that we found them okay.    Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.    Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?    Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.    Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.    I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.    Well, don't worry about it.
Well, don't worry about it.    And don't you worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.    Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Is your confidence in me fully restored?    Yes, it is, Hal.
Yes, it is, Hal.    Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?    Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.    I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.    The antenna has to be replaced.
The antenna has to be replaced.    Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.    It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.    I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.    I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.    Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.    Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.    I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.    Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.    I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.    Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I am prepared to do that anyway.    I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.    Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
CONTINUED    Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
CONTINUED    Did they have any explanation for this?
CONTINUED    Well, what is it?
CONINUED    Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
CONTINUED    Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
CONTINUED    Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?    I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm having a party tomorrow.    Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Yes, I know that sweetheart.    Are you coming to my party?
Are you coming to my party?    No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.    When are you coming home?
When are you coming home?    In three days, darling, I hope.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?    Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.    Where is Mrs. Brown?
Where is Mrs. Brown?    She's in the bathroom.
She's in the bathroom.    Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.    How many days until you come home?
How many days until you come home?    Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.    Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, Daddy.    I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?    Yes, Daddy.
Yes, Daddy.    'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.    Goodbye, Daddy.
Oh, thank you very much.    Thank you.
Thank you.    Well, how's it going back there?
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.    I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.    Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.    Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.    I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.    I'll bet it's a fortune.
And your charming little daughter?    Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.    Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.    How is gregor?
How is gregor?    He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.    Well, where are all of you off to?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.    Well, that does sound very odd.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?    No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.    Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.    Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?    I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.    Please, it really doesn't matter.
Please, it really doesn't matter.    Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?    Yes, very pleasant.
Yes, very pleasant.    Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?    Fine.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.    I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.    Yes, it's coming along very well.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.    Are you quite sure?
Are you quite sure?    Yes, really, thank you very much.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon    Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?    Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.    Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.    Really?
Really?    Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.    You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?    That's right.
That's right.    I see.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.    Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.    Fortunately, they did.
Fortunately, they did.    Well, I'm glad about that.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?    Certainly.
Certainly.    Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.    Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?    I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.    How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?    By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.    Any clue as to what it is?
Any clue as to what it is?    Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?    Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Any ideas about the colour?    Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?    Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?    I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.    There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.    When do we arrive at Clavius?
When do we arrive at Clavius?    We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?    Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Thank you.    Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?    What do you mean?
What do you mean?    Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.    I see.
I see.    I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.    I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.    Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?    No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.    Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.    I will if I can, Frank.

True.    Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?    That's true.
That's true.    Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?    That's true
That's true    There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?

Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.    Opening pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up?    It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.    Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?    Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.    All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
Yeah?    I want to pick up my car.

They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.    Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?

What's the matter with my place?    No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...    Here's hoping, baby...
Hello, again.    I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Here you go, baby.    Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?    Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...

You're gonna help us take him.    No chance.
No chance.    He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
Where's ganz?    In the back.  Down the other corridor.
You lying son of a bitch...    What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...    I don't think you're gonna make it.
I don't think you're gonna make it.    Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.    You're done.  End of story.
You're done.  End of story.    I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You got a name, cop?    Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?    Sure, anything you want.
You here to write my life story?    Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Yeah, I noticed...    Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.    Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
Yeah?    I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.    You're crazy.
You're crazy.    I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.    What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?    I got a lot to protect.
I got a lot to protect.    Bullshit.
Bullshit.    It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.    I'll think about it.
This prison gives out $400 suits?    What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...    Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...    You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.    You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.    No way to start a partnership.
No way to start a partnership.    Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.    Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Yeah.    It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?    Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.    Luther was part of the gang?
Luther was part of the gang?    What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?    I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.    Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.    Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....    I may call you worse than that.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.    Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?    Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.    I'm helpin' you, huh?
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.    I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.    I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.    Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Hey, this works pretty good.    Thank you.
Thank you.    Want to try it again?
What do you think?    I think you better put him on ice, man.
I think you better put him on ice, man.    He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.    If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.    Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.    "Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning."
"Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn ""trim"" hunt... stop moaning."    Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.    We eat when I say we eat.
We eat when I say we eat.    Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...    Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.    Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?    Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?    She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Now, where we goin', convict?    Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
I don't give out the details.    Last night, two nights ago, three?
Last night.    You have a good time?
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.    At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
Well?    It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.    This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...    Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?    If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...    But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...    Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...    You need five years training to handle a joint like...
Hey, you wanna bet?    I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.    If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...    Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.    That's never been one of my problems.
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.    What are you talkin' about?
What are you talkin' about?    You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.    I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.    The bet's off.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.    I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.    My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.    Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You made that move, huh?    While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
There.    Must be billy's girl.
Must be billy's girl.    Come on.
Let's go.    Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.    You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.    You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...    I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.    Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.    Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?    Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.    They saved your ass, convict.
They saved your ass, convict.    One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
I been waiting a long time for some money.    How much?
How much?    Half a million.
Half a million.    Jesus.
Just tell me about the money.    Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.    He's after your money.
He's after your money.    You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
We split 50-50?    Not likely, convict.
Not likely, convict.    You gonna let me keep any of it?
You gonna let me keep any of it?    Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
Where's the money?    In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Right, partner.    Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.    Yeah.  Right.
Where's the goddamn car?    You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.    ...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.    You just drove by it.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.    I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.    Shit.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.    Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.    Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
What?    Musta got some primo bondsman.
Musta got some primo bondsman.    Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?    Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.    I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.    Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.    If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.    I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.    Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...    I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.    That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?    If they don't tell me what I need to know...
If they don't tell me what I need to know...    Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?    I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...    You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...    If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...    Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.    What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.    No class...
No class...    Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?    Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
That was in style a couple years back, man.    Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.    You stay with me...
You stay with me...    No way...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.    I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Where's luther?    Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.    Hello. And goodbye.
What about Luther?    What about Ganz?
We missed.    You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.    Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.    Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
"They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the ""Don't Disturb"" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind."    So you took the rest of the night off...
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?    Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...    You sure that's the reason?
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.    Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...    Yeah. Guess not.
Yeah, I see her.    I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
That was quick.    When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.    Why?
Why?    Luther's on the move...
Notice something funny about that bus?    Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Hey, how'd my car get here?    I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.    Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.    I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.    Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.    Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
It's late, they're closing...    Don't worry about it.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...    Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
Do I get to kiss her too?    If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.    I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Hey, there she is...    Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.    If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.    Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...    Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.    Partnership?
Partnership?    Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
You okay?    Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.    You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.    Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.    There's nothin' to talk about.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.    And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?    That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..    You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.    No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.    Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Thanks.    No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.    Yeah, I read the report...
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.    Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Yeah...    Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?    Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.    You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.    Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...    Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.    You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.    Jack?
Jack?    Yeah?
Yeah?    Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.    I'll keep it in mind.
What the bell happened?    I lost them, that's what happened.
I lost them, that's what happened.    How did they get away?
How did they get away?    They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
Which one pulled the trigger?    The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.    You couldn't get to him?
What a screw-up.    Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?    I didn't have the time.
I didn't have the time.    Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.    Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?    I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
That's what you say, Cates...    Yeah.
Yeah.    But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...    The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.    Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.    I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?    Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.    I'll help you out.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.    Shit.
Billy Bear...    Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Who are all these?    They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.    Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?    Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Tell me that's not the same guy.    Hey ... Dick Tracy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?    Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.    One of  em's in the slam.
You look awful.    So do you...been a long day.
So do you...been a long day.    Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.    Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.    Doesn't look like it.
Doesn't look like it.    Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?    Nothing.
Bullshit red tape.    I'm heading out. How about you?
I got to wait for a call.    Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.    What?
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?    I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
A cop...    I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?    Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.    You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.    Who gives a fuck what you think?
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.    I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.    I don't know.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.    When? How?
When? How?    I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
What am I wanted for?    I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
I don't think your gun's loaded...    This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?    I still don't think it's loaded.
Hey, you're right.    You're hopeless.
You're hopeless.    That's the way I see it, too.
I'm all wet.    What's wrong with that?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.    What'd you do?
What'd you do?    Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.    I guess he got the message...
I guess he got the message...    Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...    Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.    Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?    I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.    If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.    Hey, you know what I really think?
Hey, you know what I really think?    Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.    I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.    What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.    Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.    Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.    Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.    Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.    What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?    I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.    That's the way I see it, too.
That's the way I see it, too.    Call me later.
Call me later.    You sure you want me to?
You sure you want me to?    Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Thanks for the coffee.    I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...    Guess people ought to know who I am...
Great place for lunch.    Yeah, one of my favorites.
Yeah, one of my favorites.    You made the front page.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...    Jack, are you okay?
Jack, are you okay?    Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...    Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...    Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...    I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.    Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...    That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...    I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....    Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?    This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?    Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.    No wonder you're so popular.
No wonder you're so popular.    No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.    So am I.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?    Jack?  What was that?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...    Jack, wait...
Jack, wait...    Just a second, that's all!
Hello.    Hi, it's me...
Hi, it's me...    Fuck you.
Hey, I don't believe it.    Hiya, kid.
Hiya, kid.    I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...    Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.    I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?    We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
You real down?    I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...    Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...    How do you know?
How do you know?    Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?    Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.    It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.    So what?
So what?    When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.    Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.    Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
Whaddya think?    What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.    Let's go, Reggie.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?    Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.    I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.    Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Three more hours...    Where is he?
Where is he?    Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...    Tell me.
Tell me.    He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
You're impossible...    That's what I always say.
Who the hell are you?    Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.    Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...    Shrink major, not a shrink.
Hard man to live with.    How would you know?
How would you know?    Hey, two days with him is enough.
Hey, two days with him is enough.    That's no bull.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...    In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Hey...    Shut up.
Shut up.    What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?    Shut up.
Stall.    What do you want?
Keep stallin'.    Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
How hot are they?    Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
How ya doin'?    Can't complain.
Can't complain.    We got a lot to talk about.
We got a lot to talk about.    Yeah, old times.
Yeah, old times.    We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?    Sure, right.
Surprise, Luther.    Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-    I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...    I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.    You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...    Don't give me this, we were partners.
Don't give me this, we were partners.    Billy, go ahead, break it...
Billy, go ahead, break it...    No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.    When?
When?    I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.    You chickenshit punk...
You chickenshit punk...    Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.    You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
Let her go.    First, the money.
Rosalie, you okay?    What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
How you doing, man?    Not bad, not bad.
You want to go outside?    Naw, right here's okay.
You sure?    I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
How about some ammo?    It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
How much?    This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...    Don't mess with me. How much?
Don't mess with me. How much?    Five bills.
Five bills.    Five.  On credit.
Five.  On credit.    This ain't a credit business.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?    Give it back.
Give it back.    Try and take it.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.    I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..    Corn-i-Lius?
Corn-i-Lius?    At your service.
What're you laughing about?    Napoleon... small.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?    San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!    The case was stolen?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!    You know exactly where they are!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!    No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.    I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...We're saved!    I'm fucked!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again    I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.    I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?    ...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?    Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...    Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.    Why?  What's wrong with me?
Why?  What's wrong with me?    ...I'm a priest! I'm here to infer life, All you want to do is destroy it.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to infer life, All you want to do is destroy it.    Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
...would you like a drink?    No thank you.
No thank you.    Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly infer, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!    They are robots!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!    Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.    Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
You are a monster, Zorg!    I know...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.    Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.    That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?    She dropped in on me... holding this.
Who are you?    I brought the girl remember?
I brought the girl remember?    The girl?
He's a she!    You noticed...
You noticed...    There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!    So you do know her.
So you do know her.    Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
They all like this in your family, father?    She's an exception..
She's an exception..    Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?    Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!    I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?    She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.    I know. I was there when she arrived.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?    "It means, ""Never without my permission""."
"It means, ""Never without my permission""."    That's what I thought.
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.    Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?    We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..    What kind of mission?
What kind of mission?    We have to save the world.
We have to save the world.    Good luck..
Good luck..    Of course.
Of course.    Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
What are you doing?    Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.    Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.    Leeloo's in trouble?
Leeloo's in trouble?    When is she not in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?    Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?    Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.    Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.    And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?    That's what I'm saying.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.    One more reason to shoot first eh?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!    Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.    That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.    And then?
And then?    And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Is there anything that can stop it?    Yes..thank God..
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?    White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.    Thank you, Mr. President.
What are we going to do?    This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
It's a miracle!!!    What is?
What is?    I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?    The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?    Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
What's she doing?    Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..    Yes. Of course..
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...    I didn't know your size.
They really made her...    Perfect.
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!    Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Where's Leeloo?    On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.    It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!    Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...    Who?
Who?    The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Leeloo... is... she's...    Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.    ...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!    I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!    Do you love her?
Do you love her?    I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!    I don't have time... I need to know.
I don't have time... I need to know.    Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.    I would like to have died in peace...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...    They are... with me...

The Fifth Element...    Take them and put them in a safe place.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?    When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.    Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!    Time is of no importance, only life is important.
When EVIL returns so shall we.    We will be ready, Lord.

To save the world.    Where have I heard this song before?

Well, I'm not smoking, okay?    Okay, I believe you.
Okay, I believe you.    We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
How's the detective business?    Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.    You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.

I don't know.  I'm sorry...    You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.    I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.    You couldn't?
You couldn't?    You don't understand...
You don't understand...    No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!    I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
You should have.    Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.    Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...

She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.    Tom... she's dead.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...    I just talked to her.
What are these?    Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
Anything harder?    There's nothing harder.
There's nothing harder.    Snuff?
Snuff?    What you see is what I got, mister.
What you see is what I got, mister.    You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.    There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
What do you want?    I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.    What are you talking about?

The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...    Bullshit.
Bullshit.    I'm telling you...
I'm telling you...    Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?    Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!    There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.

Dino...    Nobody knows anything.
What the fuck... !    I promised him to Machine.
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.    What can I do for you today?
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.    Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?    A fellow investor.
A fellow investor.    Hmm.
You said something about money.    Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
That's five thousand dollars.    Is it?
Is it?    Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.    And they are?
And they are?    I want to watch you work.
I want to watch you work.    I'll consider it.
I'll consider it.    And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.    Machine.
Machine.    If it's not him, there's no deal.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.    We can do that.
We can do that.    Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?    I'd rather you didn't.
I'd rather you didn't.    What's the problem?
What's the problem?    I'm camera shy.
I'm camera shy.    You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?    Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.    Machine's in?
Machine's in?    He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Where's that?    Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
You brought the money?    Right here.
Excellent.    Where are the women?
Where are the women?    They should be here any minute.
What are these for?    Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?    Sure.
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?    What are you... ?
What are you... ?    Take out your gun!
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.    Look, I don't know what this...
Look, I don't know what this...    Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?    I remember him.
Friend of yours?    Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...    Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?    He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...    Bring the film, or we kill him.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...    How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Is that him?    Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.    Move it, dirtbag... !
You're a dead man.    Leave him alone.
Leave him alone.    Fuck off.
... sorry...    First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?    You betrayed us.
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?    Call me Tom.
Call me Tom.    Alright, Tom.
Alright, Tom.    What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...    There are reasons for the way we do things here.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.    Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.    Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?    I figured you share information.
I figured you share information.    We do.
We do.    For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.    Why don't they come to me?
Why don't they come to me?    This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.

I'm not so sure about this.
I'm not so sure about this.    They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.    I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.    Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.    Any good?
Any good?    It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.    You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?

Celebrity Films.    Eddie.

Yeah, who's this?    I know what you did.
I know what you did.    What?
What?    I know what you did.
I know what you did.    Who is this.
Who is this.    You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...    What the fuck are you.. ?
What the fuck are you.. ?    You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
What's he talking about?    One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
I'm gonna kill you.    Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Don't bore me with that bullshit.    How'd you find me here?
Don't ask questions.    Fuck you!
Starting to recognize a pattern?    What do you want?
What do you want?    Who is Machine?
Who is Machine?    I don't know...
I don't know...    I want his name.
I want his name.    I told you, I don't know.
I told you, I don't know.    I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.    What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.    Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.    Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.    Yeah.
Yeah.    How much did he pay you?
How much did he pay you?    Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.    That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?    It was a lot of fucking money.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.    Something like that.
Something like that.    What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?    What the fuck do you want from me?
What the fuck do you want from me?    I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!    Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.    Why?
Why?    Because we're going there.
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.    You enjoy it?
You enjoy it?    Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.    Tell me what happened.
Tell me what happened.    What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...    Nobody saw you bring her in?
Nobody saw you bring her in?    There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.

What did you do with her body?    Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.    Show me.
Keep moving.    Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...    Stop talking.
Stop talking.    You got absolute zero.
You got absolute zero.    Show me where you buried her.
Show me where you buried her.    I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.    Where?  Show me where.
Where?  Show me where.    I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Do it.    Don't think I won't.
Don't think I won't.    Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?    Easy enough for you.

"That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you ""felt like it.""  Almost makes you worse."    What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.    I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.

Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.    I'm listening.
I'm listening.    As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.

Of what sort?    You are a private investigator?
You are a private investigator?    That's right.
That's right.    Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.    Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.    So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.    That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.    Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.    I was well compensated.
I was well compensated.    That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?    Never mind how I found you.
Never mind how I found you.    Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...    They're no friends of mine.
They're no friends of mine.    Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.    None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.    Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...    Shut up.
Shut up.    Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.    Shut your mouth and drive!
Shut your mouth and drive!    Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
You're making me very angry.    Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?    You're asking me why?
You're asking me why?    I'm asking.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...    Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?    Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?    Enlighten me.
Enlighten me.    Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
You almost went over your limit.    Fuck you.
Give me the film.    You'll get it when we get there.
Give me the film.    Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
He's lying.    Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Big date tonight?    Yeah... guess so.
Yeah... guess so.    Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?    Pardon me?
Pardon me?    My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.    Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.    It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.    I'll risk it.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.    Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Truman Capote.    I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.    Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.    Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Remember me?    Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.    Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.    Good for you.
How long you been working there?    Three, four years.
Three, four years.    What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?    Max.
Max.    Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...    There's not much illegal.
There's not much illegal.    Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.    You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.    I'm not a cop.
I'm not a cop.    You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.    Not quite.
Not quite.    From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?    Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.    How much?
How much?    How much do you make now?
How much do you make now?    Four hundred a week, off the books.
Four hundred a week, off the books.    Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.    Sounds good, pops.
Sounds good, pops.    Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?    Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.    "See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me ""pops."""
... Hello... ?    Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.    Interesting theory.
Interesting theory.    What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.    Child pornography.
Child pornography.    There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.

Snuff films.    I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.    What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?    First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
How old are you?    Twenty-five.
Twenty-five.    Where are your parents?
Where are your parents?    I don't know, where are yours?
I don't know, where are yours?    I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?    I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?    You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.    Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.    You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?    You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?    What about me?
What about me?    I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?    A daughter.
A daughter.    So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?    Good question.
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.    A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?    His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.    Specialty product.
Specialty product.    You're learning.
You're learning.    Where does he sell it?
Where does he sell it?    Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...    Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...    Alright, I get the picture.
Alright, I get the picture.    He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.    Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?    I'm a working stiff, pops.
I'm a working stiff, pops.    Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.    You want me to come out there and play private eye?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?    Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.    See ya.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.    It's their Presidential Suite.
It's their Presidential Suite.    Great.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?    It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Wha... ?    Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
Who is he?    I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...    Who is he, his name?
Who is he, his name?    "Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself ""Machine,"" that's what they call him.  Machine."
You don't need to be here.    What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
"I know if I had to pick, it'd be ""Choke,"" or ""Devil."""    """Devil"" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite."
What's next?    I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.    Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?    Nope.
What's this?    It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Look... that's awful generous and everything...    It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.    I try to be.
Uh huh, pleasure.    Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?    Thank you.
He's odd.    He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.    I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.    You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.    My condolences.
My condolences.    His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.    I'll do whatever I can to help.
Pittsburgh?    Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.    He succeeded.
He succeeded.    We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?    I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.    Just curious.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.    You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.    There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...    Do you want to tell me what you found?
Do you want to tell me what you found?    Cash, stock certificates, and this...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.    I'm afraid I don't...
I'm afraid I don't...    This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...    "Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a ""snuff film.""  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you."
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...    No.
No.    If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...    I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm telling you it's not that.    I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.    Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Will you watch it and see for yourself?    Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
You... you need to go to the police.    I told you I can't, not yet.
I told you I can't, not yet.    You don't have any other choice.
You don't have any other choice.    No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...    It won't work like that.
It won't work like that.    Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...    You've found missing persons before.
You've found missing persons before.    Nothing remotely like this.
Nothing remotely like this.    I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
Okay...    My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.    I'm not positive this means anything.
I'm not positive this means anything.    The checks were for odd amounts...
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...    Okay, I follow you so far...
Okay, I follow you so far...    Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.    You're joking.
You're joking.    To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
Hello... ?    I'm here.
I'm here.    Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Do you think the film could have cost that much?    For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.    Okay.
Okay.    Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?    You told me to look, so I looked.
You told me to look, so I looked.    You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Hello?    Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.    How are you?  Having any luck?
How are you?  Having any luck?    I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?    I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.    I hope it's nothing serious.
I hope it's nothing serious.    Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?    I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.    Fine...
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.    How will I get it to you?
How will I get it to you?    If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Yes... ?    Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.    I don't understand, who are... ?
I don't understand, who are... ?    I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?    Yes, but...
Yes, but...    These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...    Neil... Neil Cole.
Neil... Neil Cole.    Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?    No.
No.    Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.    They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?    That's exactly what I am.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.    You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?    No.
No.    She just seemed... depressed... ?
She just seemed... depressed... ?    She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.    What was she running from?
What was she running from?    I don't know.
I don't know.    If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?    Yes.
Yes.    September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.    We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...    Why do you think he did it?
Why do you think he did it?    It got to be too much for him.
It got to be too much for him.    You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?    There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...    I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to...    You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.    I had to ask.  I apologize.
I had to ask.  I apologize.    No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?    Of course.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...    Okay.
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.    We're all like that.
We're all like that.    Are you religious?
Are you religious?    No.
No.    You should be.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.    What?
What?    It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.

There wasn't one.  The police looked.    Do you think the police did a good job?
Do you think the police did a good job?    I don't know.  I think so.
I don't know.  I think so.    It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...    No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...    If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
How... how can you say that to me...?    Will you let me look?
Will you let me look?    My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...    You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?    Yes.
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.    It's been six years.
It's been six years.    What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
Hello... ?    Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...    I remember.  You just left...
I remember.  You just left...    I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
What are you talking about... ?    She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...    What... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.    Who is this... ?
Who is this... ?    Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...    Who are you?
Who are you?    They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...    No...
No...    He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...    No... no... no...
No... no... no...    They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...    Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?    They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
Yes... I remember Mary    You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...    Yes.  I remember her.
Do you know what happened to her?    I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
What is this?    Those are her belongings.
Those are her belongings.    Her belongings?
Her belongings?    That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?    She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?

Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...    None too discreet, is he?
None too discreet, is he?    No, sir, he is not.
No, sir, he is not.    He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...    Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.    Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Okay, I'll take it all.    Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.    Cash.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?    No, you may not.
No, you may not.    Okay.  Fine.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...    Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.    Certainly, sir.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?    What?
What?    The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.    I don't want to.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.    But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.    Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Rick...I can't.    Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Alice, you think you can leave?    What's wrong?
What's wrong?    Kincaid and Joey died last night.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.    What?
You alright?    Kristen...
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?    It was bad.
It was bad.    Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?    I can't find him.
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.    It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.    Yeah, or turn you into toast.
I can't go back to sleep again.    I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
We'll figure it out.    Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.    Then we'll stay up together.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.    Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.    I'm sure they're around.
I'm sure they're around.    Yeah, I'm not so sure.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.    You could do worse.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?    Sounds like a game show host to me.
Sounds like a game show host to me.    No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.    Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.    How'd you learn so much about dreams?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?    When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
You what?    When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
Kristen, what happened?    You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
You in a hurry?    I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.    I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.    Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.    I know.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.    We have matching luggage.
We have matching luggage.    What?
You've been up all night?    That obvious, huh?
That obvious, huh?    Then you saw him, too?
Then you saw him, too?    Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
No...    You're his sister, right?
You're his sister, right?    Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.    Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.    I know.  Uh...Alice.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.    It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...    """In her dream""?"
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!    Kristen's story really got to her.
I've been working double shifts.    Extra money, huh?
Extra money, huh?    Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.    The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
How long have you been awake?    Three days.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?    Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Not really.    Is there something we can do?
Is there something we can do?    I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.    Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?    Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.    Then what else can we do?
Then what else can we do?    Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.    Who?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.    Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.    You just feel sorry for me.
You just feel sorry for me.    Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.    It's okay, we're just about there.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.    You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Here we are.    Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
What the hell was that?    Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
You look great!    Save it for later.  Come on!
Rick, please.    Alright, I think I see salvation...
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.    Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.    It was Freddy.
It was Freddy.    Enough of that crap.
Enough of that crap.    I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
T-T-Thanks Alice...    Earth to Alice...
Hey, Rick!    Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
I don't get it.    Let me talk to you.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?    She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.    So?
So?    It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.    Nice neighborhood.
Nice neighborhood.    Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Hey man, we're all sorry...    She knew she was gonna die.
Been up with Alice.    How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.    She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.    About Freddy?
About Freddy?    What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Something the matter with the cuisine?    Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.    You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
What's wrong with me?    Your distraught.  It'll help...
I'm sorry honey, but...    Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!    Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.    Mother, you've just murdered me.  Take that to your goddamn therapy...
Something wrong with the stairs?    Avoid-all-contact-day.
Avoid-all-contact-day.    What?
What?    When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
What is it?    Oh God!  He killed them!
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.    I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.    It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
I'll tell you later.    It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.    It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.    I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Feeling better now?    Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?    You had a nasty bump.
I gotta get out of here.    You just stay put.  You need rest.
You just stay put.  You need rest.    You don't get it, he's after me...
You don't get it, he's after me...    Don't worry, honey
Excuse us, dear.    It's okay, Dan
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?    What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.    And ours.  It's our grandchild.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --    "What are you talking about?  My ""condition""?..."
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.    You're not taking my baby!
Hey...wake up.    Huh?
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?    It's lonely in there, in my room.
It's lonely in there, in my room.    My name is...
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.    How did you know that?
How did you know that?    I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?    Been having bad dreams.
Is that who you're waiting for?    No...
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.    She doesn't want me around
She doesn't want me around    Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?    Who said I...wait, what?
Who says I don't like you?    My friend, with the funny hand.
Mommy...?    Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Where is he?    He's inside you, where he hides.
What do you mean?    It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
But how...?    He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Hi, beautiful.    Jesus!  Don't do that!
Jesus!  Don't do that!    Sorry, babe.
The tickets.    They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!    I know.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?    Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.    He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
About him?    No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.    Yeah...I guess.
Yeah...I guess.    You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...    You're right.
You're right.    There you go.  Love you.
There you go.  Love you.    Me too.
I was afraid you weren't coming.    "I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing..."
"I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  ""The drunk showed up"", that kind of thing..."    That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.    No.  A deal's a deal.
Dad!    It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
Where are we going?    To take a picture.
Thanks for everything, Dad.    You sure you don't want a ride to work?
You sure you don't want a ride to work?    It's just across the park.
I'm so sorry, honey...    Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
How was the meeting?    Sobering...
Sobering...    Very funny.
Very funny.    Alice...
Alice...    Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?    Since my little girl became a mom...
Since my little girl became a mom...    You disappointed in me?
You disappointed in me?    No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
Alice!    I've got to go.
I've got to go.    No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.    But Dad --
But Dad --    Now.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.    Had kind of a long night.
Had kind of a long night.    Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.    No, the Dan part was nice...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.    Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.    Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?    There aren't any little boys on your floor.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.    He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
Did everyone call everyone?    They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
What's that got to do with it?    When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.    No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?    Why don't you two stick to reality.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?    I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...    Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?    I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.    Krueger is reality.
Krueger is reality.    And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!    What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?    Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...    That's the only reason you're alive...
Are you alright?    Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
You think that's the place she's buried?    If they actually bothered to bury her.
What?    Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
But how are we gonna --    We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
You do good work, Alice.    So did Dan.
He sure loves to stay awake.    That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.    I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.    Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.    Well we gotta do something!
I've got to write some of this down.    That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Mark, are you okay?    Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...    I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
I thought about that.    She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Then get out!    Mark!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?    Nobody thinks that.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.    It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.    Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Who's Jacob?    My baby!
My baby!    What, you named it already?
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?    I don't know!
Where are you going?    I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.    Then we'll find another way.
They think I'm nuts.    That's their problem.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?    That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.    Meaning?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.    But I've seen her grave.
But I've seen her grave.    Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
Poor woman...    No shit.
I don't understand.    She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?    Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?    My undying love.  Have some.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!    Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.    You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.    Who?
Who?    Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.    I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
These things are wild...  What do you think?    Makes you look like a nun--
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...    Yeah...
Yeah...    That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.    Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?    Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.    I want to talk about the baby.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.    Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.    All of us.  Right?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.    Two hours a day, six days a week.
Vomit?    Faint.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!    Mark...
Mark...    I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!    I can't listen to this.
It's okay.    Stick around, please?
You, too?    He invited me to his house last night.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.    It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.    How is he - ?
How is he - ?    It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.    And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
You could train someone else.    Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
What is it?    Your 'out.'  This came for you.
Your 'out.'  This came for you.    My father!  He's not - ?
My father!  He's not - ?    Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'    Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!    <u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...    We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!    That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!    You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?    Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!    You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?    Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!    You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Unidentified Flying Objects.    Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !    - any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -    I'd sooner swim!
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -    Yes?
Yes?    Which is the one - we have to worry about?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.    But if they <u>do</u>?
But if they <u>do</u>?    I don't know.
I don't know.    I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -    And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -    But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!    Helen.  I appeal to you -
Reef!    So they caught up with you, too?
So they caught up with you, too?    At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -    <u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?    What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?    Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!    Huh?
Huh?    I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?    I guess.
I guess.    One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.    So?
So?    So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'    A lot of people think like that.
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.    Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?    'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Cyclops?    Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
We're stuck tight!    Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --    'Us?'
'Us?'    Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.    Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.    What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!    I think you're right.
I think you're right.    Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Yeah?    Listen!  Hear that?
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -    Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!    You know - it <u>is</u>?
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!    Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
You hear that?    The sound again?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?    Somewhere down there?
Somewhere down there?    Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?    We'll have to look for them later.
Well?    I'm with <u>you!</u>
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.    Oh it does???
Dave - !    What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.    Right, Skipper.
Is there any way out of it?    Seems to be all around...
Seems to be all around...    What about down?
What about down?    I...don't know!
Course and speed?    Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!    What???
What course, Skipper?    Right at our one-eyed friend!
You better take Powell and Carney with you --    The frogmen?
The frogmen?    With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --    Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.    We hope!
Excuse me, Skipper---    Yes, Griff?
Yes, Griff?    All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
Skipper - could you take a look here...?    Something wrong?
Something wrong?    The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.    Why do you say that?
Why do you say that?    We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!    What????
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!    Wonderful!
Wonderful!    That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Now they feel it...down below.    Radiation level...constantly rising...
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...    Anything ---
Anything ---    It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.    What about time...?
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?    Under <u>water</u>?
Under <u>water</u>?    High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
...above Murmansk, and Finland.    Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!    What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?    <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....    The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?    If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!    What direction does the system indicate?
As we near the Pole...    There's got to be an explanation!
There's got to be an explanation!    There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
All ready?    As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.    I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.    I met Dr. Kent, once.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.    Who with?
Who with?    Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?    Huh?
Huh?    It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
What do you think?    I think I should have joined the Air Force!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.    After torpedo room:  Report!
You're sure it's Cyclops?    Take a look.
What's the running time?    Thirty-four seconds!
Right <u>at</u> him?    That's what I said!
That's what I said!    But - what can we accomplish?
But - what can we accomplish?    We can <u>ram</u> him!
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....    It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.    And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?    What?
What?    If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!    Nothing we can do, now.
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?    Minus three.
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!    Come where?
That's a <u>face</u>???    Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.    Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -    - for horrors like yourself?
Swell!    Your friend was to remain where he was!
He did!    I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?    On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.    Why?
Why?    I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.    That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?    Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?    Obviously.
Obviously.    <u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.    Thank you.
See what?    The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Well, I'll be - !    I'll be another!
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.    Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!    Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.    But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!    Toward the Pole!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.    All right - go to it.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.    Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?    No. Black.
Are you alright, Wade?    Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.    Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.    Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.    Always has been.
Always has been.    This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.    Who?
Who?    Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.    Who?
Who?    You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.    Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.    You don't believe me?
You don't believe me?    About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?    I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.    Has anybody offered to buy it?
Has anybody offered to buy it?    As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?    What is the Northcountry Development Association?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?    I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.

Twombley involved?    No.
No.    He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.    All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
What are you boys up to?    Same old shit.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --    Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.    -- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.    Yeah. I know about that.
Yeah. I know about that.    LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?    Tell me.
Tell me.    Chub says you're fired.
Chub says you're fired.    He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.    He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.    It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.    I plan to. Soon.
I plan to. Soon.    How soon?
How soon?    This spring.
This spring.    Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.    It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?    No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?    Yes.
Yes.    Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.    Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?    Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.

You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --    Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
You heard the news.    I hear Twombley got shot.
I hear Twombley got shot.    Yeah.
You see it?    Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.

I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.    This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?    Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.    You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.    Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?    No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
He's on to us!    Shit! What are we gonna do?
Shit! What are we gonna do?    Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.    You can't buy Wade off.
You can't buy Wade off.    We bought you.

It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.    Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.    Guaranteed, eh?
Guaranteed, eh?    Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?

Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.    If you get it?
If you get it?    Yeah.
Yeah.    You might not kill it.
You might not kill it.    You think so.
You think so.    You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.

The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.    What happened?
What happened?    Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Safety on?    Yeah.
Yeah.    This way.
This way.    Sun's gettin high.
Sun's gettin high.    Deers have ears too.

You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.    Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.    Yeah.
Yeah.    Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.    He sure as hell won't.
I'm fucking out of here.    Lawford?

I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.    What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.    Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.    Yeah.
Yeah.    Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
Those are the Hoyts.    I don't care. They're out.
I don't care. They're out.    Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Why do they do that?    Do what?
Do what?    You know.
You know.    Break stuff?
Break stuff?    Yeah. It's stupid.
Yeah. It's stupid.    I guess they're stupid.
I guess they're stupid.    Did you do that when you were a kid?
Did you do that when you were a kid?    Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.    Was it funny?
Was it funny?    To us it was.
To us it was.    But it's not funny now.
But it's not funny now.    It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.    I bet you did lots of bad things.
I bet you did lots of bad things.    What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?    I just think you used to be bad.
I just think you used to be bad.    No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?    No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.    I don't want to.
I don't want to.    Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.    It's not that.
It's not that.    What then?
What then?    It's stupid.
It's stupid.    It's fun.
It's fun.    I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.    Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.    No.
No.    No what?
No what?    No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.    You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.    I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.    Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.    I called Mommy.
I called Mommy.    What? You called Mommy? Just now?
What? You called Mommy? Just now?    Yes.
Yes.    Jesus, why?
Jesus, why?    I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.    Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?    See, I knew you'd be mad.
See, I knew you'd be mad.    Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?    I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.    Well, I guess I am. I planned this, I planned all this, you know. I mean, it's sort of pathetic, but I planned it. You shouldn't have called your mother.  C'mon, we're gonna call her before she leaves.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.    Yes.
Yes.    "That's all you got to say? ""Yes""."
"That's all you got to say? ""Yes""."    Yes.
Yes.    She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?    Yes.
Yes.    Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.    That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Dad.    I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Are we going in this?    Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.    It's pretty old.
It's pretty old.    It belongs to Pop.

No.    What do you want, then?
What do you want, then?    Nothing.
Nothing.    You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?    Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --    I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.    Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.    Okay.
Okay.    Fine.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.    What are you sorry for?
What are you sorry for?    I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.    I want to go home.

That's illegal, you know.    I know.
I know.    You're a policeman.
You're a policeman.    Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.    Oh.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.    I want to go home.
I want to go home.    Okay, let's go home, then.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!    Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Tomorrow, Gordon.    Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.    Where's the plow?
Where's the plow?    Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.    His son-in-law damn near killed me.

Huh?    At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.    Don't go playing policeman.

What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.    You don't want the extra police pay?
You don't want the extra police pay?    I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying that.    Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.    Fuck you.
Fuck you.    That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
What's the hurry?    A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.    Huh?
Huh?    I figured you already heard.
I figured you already heard.    Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?    Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.    Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?    You mean Twombley?
You mean Twombley?    Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.    I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.    I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.    You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.    Like hell.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.    You want me to follow them to Littleton?
You want me to follow them to Littleton?    Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.    It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.    Something bugging you?
Something bugging you?    Yeah. A few things.
Yeah. A few things.    Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
How you holding up, Wade?    I'm fine, fine.
I'm fine, fine.    You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.    You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?    On what you pay me?
On what you pay me?    Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
What do I have to do for it?    Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.    I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.    So?
So?    He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.    Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.    You? Why?
You? Why?    Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.    That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.    What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?    Want to buy?

Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.    I won't. You interested?
I won't. You interested?    Maybe.
Maybe.    You and Mel Gordon?
You and Mel Gordon?    Could be.
Could be.    Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.    You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?    The key, Wade.
The key, Wade.    Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Lillian!    Where's Jill?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --    Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?    Yeah.
Yeah.    She's grown up some, hasn't she?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?    Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.    Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.    I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?    No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.    We should talk.
We should talk.    We've done all our talking, Wade.
We've done all our talking, Wade.    It's just...
It's just...    Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?    Yeah, lots.
Yeah, lots.    See. Get your boots.
See. Get your boots.    Hi honey.
No problem. Look, I...    You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.    Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?    You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?    Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.    Did you get his number?
Did you get his number?    I know who it is.
I know who it is.    Good. Who?
Good. Who?    Mel Gordon.
Mel Gordon.    I still don't understand --
I still don't understand --    From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.    For a while.
For a while.    How's she doing?
How's she doing?    Okay. She's fine.
Okay. She's fine.    You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.    See you tomorrow, maybe.
See you tomorrow, maybe.    You okay?
You okay?    Yeah.
You okay?    Yeah.
Yeah.    I'm sorry about what I said.
I'm sorry about what I said.    Said what?
Said what?    About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?    Forget it.
Forget it.    I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.    I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
You don't mean that.    Yeah. I mean that.
Yeah. I mean that.    No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.    The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Call me.    Tonight. Let's get together.
Tonight. Let's get together.    Okay.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.    There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.    I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...    I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.    ...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.    I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.    Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Money.    Jack doesn't need money.
Jack doesn't need money.    Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.    Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?    Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.    The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?    No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.    You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.    No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.    But not now.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.    You knew me as a kid.
You knew me as a kid.    Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.    What way?
What way?    After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.    It's nice.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?    I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.    Then... I guess you have to.
Then... I guess you have to.    There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.    Oh, Wade.
Oh, Wade.    I've been thinking about it, that's all.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.    You've been married twice --
You've been married twice --    It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?    Alright. I'll think about it.
Alright. I'll think about it.    Good.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?    Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?    I know your parents.
I know your parents.    I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?    The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Strange.    Think they're alright?
Think they're alright?    Of course! I would've heard.
Of course! I would've heard.    How?
How?    I don't know for Christ's sake!
This is nuts.    Wade.
What happened?    Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?    It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.    I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?    Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
Going somewhere, Margie?    I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.    Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.    Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.    There's a furnace.
There's a furnace.    You're not using it today?
You're not using it today?    It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.    Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
Coffee's perked.    When did she die?
When did she die?    Is...? She's dead then?
It makes me sad.    Can --?
Can --?    Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.    How's that?
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'    Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to infer somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to infer somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.    What the hell are you talking about?
What the hell are you talking about?    I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.    Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?    Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--    Hold on!
Hold on!    Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.    You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?    Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --    Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.    Yes. Here's your ticket.
Yes. Here's your ticket.    You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
Who are you?    I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?    He's asleep. We were up very late.
He's asleep. We were up very late.    Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.    Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.    Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.    Something about my father?
Something about my father?    Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.    Can't it wait, then?
Take care, Wade.    You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
It don't look right.    What?
What?    The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.    Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.    I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.    This town sucks.
This town sucks.    "Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with ""Home Made Cooking"", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong."
Marg!    That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.    Marg! You got orders!
You talked to Jack?    Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.    The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.    Jack?
Jack?    The other guy.
The other guy.    Where... how'd you hear that?
Where... how'd you hear that?    CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?    No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?    It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.    His office. You mean my old office.
His office. You mean my old office.    Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.    He got his deer yet?
He got his deer yet?    No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
Rolfe.    A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
Just do it.    Atta-go.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!    Nothing.
Nothing.    You no-good pup!
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?    Sleeping.
Sleeping.    You remember Margie Fogg?
You remember Margie Fogg?    From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?    How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.    We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?    Yeah.
Where's Ma?    She's coming.
Yeah.    I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.    Is there something wrong with the phone?
Is there something wrong with the phone?    In the living room.
In the living room.    Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?    Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.    Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Pop, for Christ's sake!    You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!    You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.    Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?    Love! I'm made of love!
Love! I'm made of love!    Call it what you want.
Call it what you want.    Everything you know is from me.
Everything you know is from me.    Yeah.
Yeah.    Bang!
Bang!    You and me.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!    Crawl!
Crawl!    Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!    I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Rolfe.    Wade?
Wade?    Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?    There was something. It happened up your way.
There was something. It happened up your way.    Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.    Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.    No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.    He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.    Who?
Who?    Twombley.
Twombley.    No shit.
No shit.    You think Jack shot him?
You think Jack shot him?    Well, it was an accident.
Well, it was an accident.    They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.    Huh?
Huh?    The night before the shooting.
The night before the shooting.    How was she?
How was she?    Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.    Who?
Who?    Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.    What happened?
What happened?    A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.    Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I guess.    Get some sleep.
Get some sleep.    I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.    Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Haven't you already done a bit of that?    No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.    What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?    No thanks. I don't drink.
No thanks. I don't drink.    Yeah. I forgot.
What about Margie?    What about her?
What about her?    Well, do you still plan to get married?
Well, do you still plan to get married?    Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.    Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?    I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.    Want to know what I think happened?
Find them everywhere.    I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.    Which is?
Which is?    That it wasn't an accident.
That it wasn't an accident.    Then who shot him?
Then who shot him?    Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.    Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.    Money.
Money.    Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.    They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?    I don't know. You tell me.
I don't know. You tell me.    Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?    Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?    Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.    So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.    A hunting accident is perfect.
A hunting accident is perfect.    Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?    Not particularly.
Not particularly.    Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?    I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.    Yeah.
Yeah.    I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.    Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?    It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It may have happened, but not the way you said.    You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?    It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.    We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.    And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.    Well, I never heard that one.
Well, I never heard that one.    I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.    That's what you think.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.    Wade, are you alright?
Wade, are you alright?    But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.    For what?
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?    Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.    Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.    Yeah, no duh.
You don't want to say hi to your father?    I'm sure he's busy.
I'm sure he's busy.    Don't you even want to ask?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.    Alice...
Alice...    Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.    You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...    Back at The Fishbowl?
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.    I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.    I'm sorry, honey.
I'm sorry, honey.    No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.    Your father never means to be so...
Your father never means to be so...    I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.    Some kids were teasing you?
Some kids were teasing you?    That's not really the point.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.    Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
Mom?    Yes dear?
Yes dear?    I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Daddy. Daddy, please...    Jim... for godsake!
I don't drink coffee.    You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.    No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.    So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.    Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.    Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?    Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.    That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.    It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
He didn't leave us.    You are a resilient man, Mr.
Oooooh, I'm good.    Hey, you guys back already?
How was...  ...the ballet?    It was the experience of a lifetime.
It was the experience of a lifetime.    How `bout a hug for the old man.
Alice!    Daddy...
Daddy...    Alice... I...
How you doing, sweetie?    Been better, Dad... You?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...    It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
There they are!    Okay, I'm slowing us down.
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.    Did we warn them off?
Did we warn them off?    Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.    They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.    The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.    Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Do you see the maintenance panel?    Got it.
Got it.    Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.    Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.    Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
It's cut.    cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.    Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.    You read my mind.
You read my mind.    Put your pilot on.
Put your pilot on.    He's busy being dead.
Who's flying the fucking plane?    I'm doing what I can.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.    Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?    Got it.
Got it.    Stay cool.
How we doing, Colonel?    We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Uh, we got a problem here.    Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.    No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.    Lemme take a look.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.    Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.    Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.    We don't know that.
We don't know that.    Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.    That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
They aren't answering their hails.    This doesn't make sense.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.    I prefered the terrorists.
I prefered the terrorists.    That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Sir, you threw out page two.    Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?    It was a good ad-lib, sir.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.    Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.    Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.    An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.    Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
Can we do that?    We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
But they start executing hostages in    I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.    Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?    Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.    Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.    If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?    To swear you in as President.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?    Yes, Mr. President.
Yes, Mr. President.    Why?
Why?    Because it is my duty.
Because it is my duty.    You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.    My loyalty was never to my country.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.    About goddamn time.
About goddamn time.    Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.    Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.    Roger.
That's affirmative.    Ga get it.
We've already been inspected.    Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
The rest of the secret service?    Dead.
Dead.    How many others killed?
How many others killed?    Nine.
Nine.    Any of us?
Who did this?    We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.    A secret service agent. It must be.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.    why did they do that?
why did they do that?    Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.    Well it worked.
How?    Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.    Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.    We're not going to make it.
We're not going to make it.    Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.    Where are we now?
Where are we now?    Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.    No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.    Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.    Stand by.
Stand by.    Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?    Tower, here.
Tower, here.    This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.    Copy, Air Force One.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.    The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.    This is a remarkable aircraft.
This is a remarkable aircraft.    You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.    A dubious distinction, no?
A dubious distinction, no?    I guess it depends on your perspective.
And all these rooms here?    Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.    Thank you.
*                     Please tell me your name.    Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.    And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.    How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?    Scared. We're scared.
You're pointing a gun at me.    Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.    What do you want with us?
What do you want with us?    Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
Now, or he dies, please.    Come on, Alice.
Leave my daughter alone.    Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...    What do you know of my husband?
What do you know of my husband?    I know he left you behind.
I know he left you behind.    My husband is a very courageous man.
My husband is a very courageous man.    Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Do you have to be so brutal?    Yes
Yes    Why? Do you enjoy it?
Why? Do you enjoy it?    I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.    How can you? I mean they're people.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.    That was war.
That was war.    So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.    No.
No.    Say something dear.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.    You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.    Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Four...    Jim...
Jim...    Three...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?    You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.    Over my dead body.
Over my dead body.    No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.    Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.    Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Stop.    You'll do it?
You'll do it?    Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.    Good. Good.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.    You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?    One thing I've learned as
There goes your ride.    Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!    If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.    Hold on, Alice.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.    Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.    Twenty minutes?
Twenty minutes?    You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.    Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Finally, we can bargain.    I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.    They've gotta be joking.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.    Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?    Gravity.
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.    We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...    They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.    Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.    Got it.
I'll not going without my family.    Yes, sir.
Sir, we stay with the President.    That isn't necessary.
May I speak to you for a moment?    Can't it wait?
Can't it wait?    No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.    Rose, I don't have time for this.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.    She's a big girl.  She understands.
She's a big girl.  She understands.    How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.    And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
You know what?    What?
What?    I miss you. And I miss her.
I miss you. And I miss her.    But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.    I wish it were that easy...
I'll make it up to you, I promise.    I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.    This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
How did your speech go?    Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.    Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
I don't know why you stayed.    Please... don't start with me.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.    Both of you.
What are you doing?    Flying the plane.
Flying the plane.    You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
The fax machines.    Excuse me?
Excuse me?    The fax machines.
The fax machines.    No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.    No. I thought about this, Mr.
Where are we sending it?    White House Situation room.
Someone should give you a raise.    Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
Did they say anything about my family?    They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.    Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
and if that means negotiating...    You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.    But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?    Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
What's going on?    We're under attack.
We're under attack.    Where's my family?
Where's my family?    We're handling it, sir.
One.    But...
But...    Two... THREE. GO!
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.    Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?    who can I say is calling?
who can I say is calling?    This is the President.
This is the President.    Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.    Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.    Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.    You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?    Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....    Thank you for calling the white House...
Thank you for calling the white House...    No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.    I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
You wanna knock of f?    No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?    He and the NRA don't like the wording.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.    I might still have a few chips left.
I might still have a few chips left.    *                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.

This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.    Other way around, sir.
Other way around, sir.    Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
It's bait.  Don't take it.    Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.    Did we tape the Duke game?
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.    We'll just say it was in bad taste.
You give me ulcers.    That's my job.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.    Yes, sir.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.    Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?    I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Shepherd.    Sir...
My god. I think that was a MiG.    A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.    Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
Shit.    How long's it been since you flew, sir?
How long's it been since you flew, sir?    Twenty-five years.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.    They better. Fuel's almost gone.
IT'S OPEN!    DO YOU SEE TEEM?
WE'RE HOOKED!    We're hooked. Hove into position.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.    Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.    Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.    Commissioner.
What?    I just wish it was that simple.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.    That just doesn't make any sense.
That just doesn't make any sense.    I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.    I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...    You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Forget it.  I was reading.    I was reading too.
I was reading too.    What's the story?
What's the story?    Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...    I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Kruger, Sagittarius.    Commissioner, Aquarius.
Did you feel that?    Yes I did...
Yes I did...    Felt like a large asteroid.
Felt like a large asteroid.    Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?    What is it, Mary?
What is it, Mary?    Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Oveur.    Dunn.
Shut down accelerators.    Accelerators down.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.    You better check it, Unger.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.    You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Dunn.    Sir?
Sir?    You better take this.
Elaine.    Te...!
Te...!    That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
It's got to be stopped!    But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.    I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ted, what's wrong?    Ask Simon.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.    There's nothing wrong with me!
There's nothing wrong with me!    Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.    You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Elaine.    Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Elaine, what happened to us?    Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.    Who's that, Ted?
Who's that, Ted?    Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.    And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.    Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.    If that's the way you want it.
If that's the way you want it.    That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.    Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
Ted!  What are you...?    I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Ted, we're taking off!    Let me by, Elaine.
What are you doing, Ted?    I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Ted.    Not now, Elaine!
Not now, Elaine!    Ted!
Elaine.    Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.    Elaine, we have to go back.
Elaine, we have to go back.    We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.    Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.    Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.    I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.    What word would you use, Elaine?
What word would you use, Elaine?    The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.    What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.    I'd use the word insane.
I'd use the word insane.    There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.    Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Elaine!    Ted!
Ted!    Elaine, what's going on?
Elaine, what's going on?    Ted, there's no time to explain.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.    Ted, please be careful.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.    Not now, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine.    I mean until we start to burn up.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.    That was very well put, Ted.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.    I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.    That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Simon just ejected!    Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.    You mean...
You mean...    That's right -- premature ejection.
That's right -- premature ejection.    What will happen to him, Ted?
What will happen to him, Ted?    The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Are you afraid?    Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.    I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!    Set!
Set!    Now!
Now!    Compute!
Ted, the lever!    Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.    The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.    What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.    I mean for Ted.
I mean for Ted.    You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.    Is that a good sign, Doctor?
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.    Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Is he making any progress, Doctor?    Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.    Simon.
Simon.    Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.    And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.    But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.    You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.    I'm so excited, Simon.
I'm so excited, Simon.    I guess this is a first for you.
I guess this is a first for you.    No, I've been excited before.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.    Simon, why has he become so... so...
Simon, why has he become so... so...    So mentally ill?
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.    Don't be too long.
Have you got it straightened out now?    I think so.
I think so.    That's my girl.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.    Roger.
Simon, what's happening?!    He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.    Can't we change course?
Can't we change course?    We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
My career is shot.    Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.    Maybe.
Maybe.    Simon, what are you saying?!
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.    Yes, sir.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.    I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?    We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
Roger.    You can do it from up here, Captain.
You can do it from up here, Captain.    I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.    No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.    Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
"Intermitant failure in scan mode ""R"". Analyze."    Negative.
Negative.    That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.    Negative.
Negative.    That's not possible.
That's not possible.    Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.    That's okay, ROK.
That's okay, ROK.    Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?    Go ahead.
Go ahead.    You have great tits.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.    Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...    Request; life support systems check.
Request; life support systems check.    Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.    Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.    There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?    We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.    I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.    Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?    It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.    No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?    Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?    Scraps.
Scraps.    Can I hold him?
Can I hold him?    Sure.
Sure.    He's a boy dog.
He's a boy dog.    Yeah.
Yeah.    Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.    We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...    Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.    I don't want to hear that word!
I don't want to hear that word!    Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.    All right.  Here.
All right.  Here.    What...?
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.    I don't want to live anymore.
I don't want to live anymore.    Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.    What?
What?    That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.    You're sure?
You're sure?    I'm sure.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.    How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.    No.  Poached.  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.    Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.    Just poached on toast.  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.    All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.    Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.    Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?    Sixteen 'C', why?
Sixteen 'C', why?    He's carrying a bomb.
He's carrying a bomb.    A b...
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.    What should I say?
What should I say?    Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Captain Oveur?    Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.    We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.    Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.    Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.    Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
You folks need any help?    Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.    Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?    Yes.
Yes.    It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.    Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.    Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.    Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
I have to see Bud Kruger.    Do you have an appointment, sir?
Do you have an appointment, sir?    No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.    You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.    All right, it's a matter of death.
All right, it's a matter of death.    Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
You can't go in there!    Don't try to stop me!
Don't try to stop me!    But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
Are you on the Mercury mission?    That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.    Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.    You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.    I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Striker.    Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?    That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.    Then Elaine was right.
Then Elaine was right.    Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!    Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?    Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.    You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.    Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?    Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.    I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.    You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
You've been hurt.    I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.    No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
Do you want to talk about it.    I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.    No.  I mean your relationship.
No.  I mean your relationship.    We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.    Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.    People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.    Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.    Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.    Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.    I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.    Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.    That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Ah, won't you sit down?    Thank you. Cream?
Thank you. Cream?    No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.    Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?    Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?    No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.    Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.    But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?    Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.    I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.    I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.    You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.    Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.    That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?    No. I'm all alone.
No. I'm all alone.    Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.    That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.    Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.    Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.    Something about a plane with no pilot?
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.    Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.    Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Both pilots!    Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Can you fly this airplane and land it?    Surely you can't be serious.
Surely you can't be serious.    I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?    Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.    Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.    Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?    Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?    I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.    Surely there must be something you can do.
Surely there must be something you can do.    I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
George Zipp said that?    "And the last thing he said to me, ""Doc,"" he said, ""Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"" he said, ""but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."""
"And the last thing he said to me, ""Doc,"" he said, ""Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"" he said, ""but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."""    Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
Captain, how soon can we land?    I can't tell.
Can't you take a guess?    Well...not for another two hours.
Well...not for another two hours.    You can't take a guess for another two hours?
You can't take a guess for another two hours?    No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?    I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?    That's right.
That's right.    We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?    Yes. Yes, of course.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.    A hospital? What is it?
A hospital? What is it?    It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.    Certainly.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?    Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.    Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
What did he have?    He had fish.
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.    Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?    He had fish, too.
Just how serious is it, doctor?    Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?    No.
No.    All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?    Well...
No. No one that I know of.    I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Elaine!    Ted!
Ted!    I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.    I just don't want to go over it any more.
I just don't want to go over it any more.    I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.    I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.    Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?    It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.    I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.    Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.    Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.    Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.    You expect me to believe that?
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.    But if you'll just give me...
But if you'll just give me...    It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Ted, what are you doing here?    Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.    You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
What's the matter?    My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.    Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.    I love you, Elaine.
I love you, Elaine.    I love you.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?    I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.    That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.    But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.    Headquarters!? What is it?
Headquarters!? What is it?    It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.    Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.    Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
What's his problem?    That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!    Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.    A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!    That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Rain.    And a little ice.
And a little ice.    And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.    Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.    It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.    What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?    Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
But Ted, you're the only...    I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Ted...    Yes?
Yes?    I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.    Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.    The gear is down.
See them, Elaine?    Uh-huh.
We have a visitor.    Hello.
We'd better get back now.    Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.    Who wants to be first?
Airsick?    I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.    Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.    You promise you'll write.
You promise you'll write.    Every day.
Good-bye, darling.    Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.    So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.    Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.    Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling.    Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.    Good-bye, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?    Yes, Captain?
Yes, Captain?    Did you decide on a runway yet?
Did you decide on a runway yet?    Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.    You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!    Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
He's right on the heading.    All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.    Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'    Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
Oh, I can't stand it.    What is it?
How ya doing, honey?    Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.    Here.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!    I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!    I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.    I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.    Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.    ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.    We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.    ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.    The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
Hi!    I'm Randy.
I'm Randy.    I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!    I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.    Oh, I'd love to.
Oh, I'd love to.    Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?    I will, but Jim won't.
Yes?    Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?    Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?    Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?    Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.    Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Roger.    Huh?
Roger.    Huh?
We have clearance, Clarence.    Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?    No, why don't you take care ot it?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.    All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Excuse me, Sister?    Yes?
Yes?    There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...    Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.    Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.    Of course.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.    Thank you.
Do you feel all right, sir?    Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we infer dinner?    No. No thank you.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...    The cockpit? What is it?
The cockpit? What is it?    It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.    Would you go up, please?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.    Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.    Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?    You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.    The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.    Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?    Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.    A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.    I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.    I like my horizons narrow.
I like my horizons narrow.    Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
You okay?    Yeah...
You are Cassandra?    That's right.
That's right.    We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--    Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
He's not here.  Why ask me?    The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.    She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
In there.    Show me.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?    Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?    You don't have squat.
You don't have squat.    You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!    I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?    Lay off, asshole.
Lay off, asshole.    I may be an asshole, but at least I'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.
William Harcourt?    Yes...
Yes...    I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.    Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.    You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.    That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...    No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.    This is becoming a serious breach of security.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.    He didn't recognize me.
He didn't recognize me.    It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.    This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
Kill them both.    Here?
Here?    Do it!
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.    Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.    What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.    I am George.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?    My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.    Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?    "That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like ""ss'ai k'ss"", two words in my language which mean ""excrement"" and ""cranium""."
Let's talk Hubley.    His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.    With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.    Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.    Nice signal, dickwad!
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?    There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.    The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...    The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?    Yes.
Yes.    Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
What is wrong?    Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Well... yes, quite possibly.    Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?    Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--    Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
What's this?  What's going on?    Nothing.
Nothing.    Nothing?
Nothing?    Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
What is this?    A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Get the picture?    And that fits?
And that fits?    Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.    And still it fits?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.    How the hell do you know that?
How the hell do you know that?    A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.    "So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that ""possible"" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night."
"So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that ""possible"" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night."    I believe I should interview the widow alone.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.    Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.    Did you learn anything?
Did you learn anything?    A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.    Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?    She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.    Did you talk to him?
Did you talk to him?    He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...    We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Why did you do it?    Why'd I do what?
Why'd I do what?    Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...    My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Who said that?    At the end of the bar.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?    Uh, Matthew...
Uh, Matthew...    Back off, George.
Back off, George.    But I-- .
But I-- .    I'll handle it.
Screw you.    Screw me?  That can't be right.
Tell me.    Your mother mates out of season.
Your mother mates out of season.    That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .    Stay back!  I'm okay.
You know that guy?    From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.    How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?    In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.    Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?    Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Which one is that?  Raw what?    This is mole.  It's good.
This is mole.  It's good.    I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?    Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?    "Ss'loka'.  It means literally ""small but intelligent creature"".  It loses much in the translation."
"Ss'loka'.  It means literally ""small but intelligent creature"".  It loses much in the translation."    And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.    Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.    Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Who is he?    Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.    When will Strader return?
I believe he is probably lying.    Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?    My wife?  She worries about me.
Yeah... I know the routine.    You are married?
You are married?    Was.  Divorced.
Was.  Divorced.    We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.    It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.    I appreciate your honesty, George.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...    Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
"... and so, and so the doctor says, ""If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?""  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?"    In the other man's rectum.
In the other man's rectum.    Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Your health...    Ta ss'trakyona'...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.    No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.    You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.    Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
I'm going home.    Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Where'd you get this?!!    A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
She's going to divorce me.    George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?    She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
Well, let's roll, George.    To the... to the beach?
To the... to the beach?    Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Stop the car.    Why?
Why?    Please, I must get out here.
Please, I must get out here.    Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.    Stop the car!
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.    Thank you.
What was that about?    Nothing.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.    Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...    ... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.    You must leave me alone on this.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!    No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.    The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?    ... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.    How potent?
How potent?    "Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The ""high"" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor."
"Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The ""high"" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor."    We?  You've taken it?
We?  You've taken it?    We all did.
We all did.    Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?    No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.    Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?    Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.    I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--    Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.    If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.    No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Uh, George...    Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...    Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.    The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.    Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
Shit!    Ss-ai!
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.    It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.    There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
No!  We must do this alone.    Do what?!  George-- ?!
What is this?!    ... It's Harcourt.
... It's Harcourt.    Harcourt is dead.
Harcourt is dead.    No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...    Tell me about it...
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.    We can't let him get away.
We can't let him get away.    Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?    Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.    But there's no more drug.
But there's no more drug.    You understand that.  But how many others will?
How do I look?    You look very good.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.    What is it?
What is it?    Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.    Only holds five.
Only holds five.    Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.    No... two.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.    Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
You think this is the guy who did it?    We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?    To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.    Who else can I ask around here?
Who else can I ask around here?    Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.    I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
That where Anderson worked?    Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.    ... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.    Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?    For you, anything.
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.    Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.    I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?    Sure.  Just a minute.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?    Ss'kya'ta'.
Ss'kya'ta'.    What's that?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?    Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.    Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, I heard of it.    That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...    Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--    The human?
The human?    Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.    Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?    Yeah.
Yeah.    Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.    Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.    That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.    Yeah, I'll bet.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?    You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
What kind of test?    Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.    Did he find anything?
Yeah, Sykes?    Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.    Departmental policy.
Departmental policy.    You?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.    Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...    Don't tell me what to think.
Hope their plumbing's the same.    It is.
How can I go?    Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.    What?
What?    Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...    Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--    But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.    Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?    Whatever gave you that idea?
You got your vest?    Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.    Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.    I got him.  Don't get pinned.
Get outta there!    I can't!  Do you mind!
I can't!  Do you mind!    I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
This floor's freezing.    Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?    Would you, Sir?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.    Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?    Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Movement!    Position?
Position?    Can't lock up...
Can't lock up...    Talk to me, Hudson.
Talk to me, Hudson.    Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.    Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Okay, let's do it.    Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.    Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.    Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.    Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.    Say again?  All after incinerators?
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.    Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.    Yes.  That follows.
Yes.  That follows.    But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.    That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.    You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?    Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.

It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.    Could it be intelligent?
Could it be intelligent?    Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.    How long until it blows?
How long until it blows?    I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
And it's too late to shut it down?    I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
I'll go.    What?
What?    I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.    All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.    See you soon.
HOW MUCH TIME?    PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!    WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
Ripley...    She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.    In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
You did okay, Bishop.    Well, thanks, I --
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...    You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Have they located my daughter yet?    Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Is she...?    Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Amy.    Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.    Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...    I get the picture.
I get the picture.    Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.    They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.    You are a head case.  Have a donut.
No.  There's no way!    Hear me out...
Hear me out...    I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?    Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.    I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.    That's right.
That's right.    Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?    It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.    What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?    If I go.
If I go.    If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...    Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...    No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...    Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.    That's the plan.  My word on it.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?    Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I hope you're right.  I really do.    I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
That the atmosphere processor?    Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.    Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...    That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.    She's right.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.    Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.    Why not?
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --    They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?    This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --    Bullshit!
You son of a bitch.    Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.    What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.    Corporal Hicks!?
Corporal Hicks!?    This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.    You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.    You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.    But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --    Now, wait a second --
Now, wait a second --    You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?    Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.    Sorry to disappoint you.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.    You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.    These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?    We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Still nothing from the colony?    Dead on all channels.
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.    It's insured.
What's he scanning for?    PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.    Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?    Thirty-eight...simulated.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.    The structure seems intact.  They have power.
One of us?    Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...    Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
What is it?    I don't know.
I don't know.    Proceed inside.
So.    So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.    So?  So?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!    Shut up.  Just shut up!
I told them to fall back...    They're but off!  Do something!
How do you feel?    All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...    Forget it.
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...    Sir?
Sir?    Yes, Hicks?
Yes, Hicks?    Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.    What's the question?
What's the question?    Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?    All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
Are there any questions?  Hudson?    How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...    ...We're coming in.
...We're coming in.    He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
Sir, the CPU is on-line.    Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.    Alive?
Alive?    Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?    You tell me.  I only work here.
Save it.    Sure, Hicks.
Let's get the fuck out of here!    Not that tunnel, the other one!
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!    Are you finished?  You okay?
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.    Aye-firmative.
We got problems.    I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.    I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
The corner!  Ready?    Do it!
Seventeen meters.    Let's get these things lit.
Well you're not reading it right!    Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Let's go!  Let's go!    Fuckin' A!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.    Poor bastard.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?    About seventeen days.
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.    We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.    That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
They're in the approach corridor.    On my way.
Now many?    Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.    But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
They'll get us.    Maybe.  Maybe not.
Maybe.  Maybe not.    Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?    If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
What's this?    Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.    Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.    Yeah.  I've noticed.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.    The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.    Let's waste him.  No offense.
It's game time.    Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.    We didn't miss anything.
Locked.    Stand back.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --    All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Hicks, don't let him leave.    We ain't going anywhere.
Ellen.    Don't be long, Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?    No.  Have you?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.    Fuck you.
Fuck you.    Anytime.  Anywhere.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?    Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.    Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!    Hudson, give us a break.
It's inside the complex.    You're just reading me.
You're just reading me.    No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
Sounds like you, Hicks.    The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Looks like it stung him.    Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.    Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...    She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.    Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Thanks.    Uh, what's next?
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.    How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.    I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.    Think of what?  We're fucked.
Think of what?  We're fucked.    What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.    Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
They cut the power.    What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...    Just get back here!
Range twenty meters.    Seal the door.
Fifteen meters.    I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.    They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Nine meters.  Eight.    Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Can't be.  That's inside the room!    It's readin' right.  Look!
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?    Yeah.  What?
Yeah.  What?    There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.    Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'

So what do I tell this guy?    Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
And how are we today?    Terrible.
Terrible.    Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.    How long have I been on Gateway station?
How long have I been on Gateway station?    Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?    No.. I've slept enough.
What did you say?    Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Casey.  She's my only friend.    What about me?
I don't want you for a friend.    Why not?
Why not?    Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.    They're dead.
They're dead.    Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.    You promise?
You promise?    Cross my heart.
Cross my heart.    And hope to die?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.    The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?    Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.    You're really something, ace.
I guess we're not leaving, right?    I'm sorry, Newt.
I'm sorry, Newt.    You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.    I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.    Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.    My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Yes, there are, aren't there.    Why do they tell little kids that?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.    Did one of those things grow inside her?
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.    Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?    No, it's different, honey.
No, it's different, honey.    Did you ever have a baby?
Did you ever have a baby?    Yes.  A little girl.
Yes.  A little girl.    Where is she?
Where is she?    Gone.
Gone.    You mean dead.
Don't go!  Please.    I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.    Wah...?  Where are...?
Wah...?  Where are...?    Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.    I know, honey.  Me too.
Burke!  Open the door!    Look!
Come on.  Crawl faster.    DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?    Sure.  Go left.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!    Newt, wait!
I knew you'd come.    Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Mommy...Mommy?    Right here, baby.  Right here.
Are we going to sleep now?    That's right.
That's right.    Can we dream?
Can we dream?    Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Look, I told you...    It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...    That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...    Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...    ...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
Why won't you check out LV-426?    Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.    What are you talking about. What people?
How many colonists?    Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.    Sweet Jesus.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!

Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.    Certainly!
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?    Indeed.
Indeed.    These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.    His Grace is very angry with you.
His Grace is very angry with you.    What do you mean?
Maestro.    Good morning.
Good morning.    Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!    Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.    Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.    Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.    And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?    Yes.
Yes.    Is there a part for me?
Is there a part for me?    No.
No.    How do you know?
How do you know?    Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.    Why not?
Why not?    Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?    Where?
Where?    In a harem.
In a harem.    What's that?
What's that?    A brothel.
A brothel.    Oh!
Oh!    A Turkish brothel.
A Turkish brothel.    Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.    My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.    Perhaps.
What does he look like?    You might be disappointed.
You might be disappointed.    Why?
Why?    Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.    Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Did you know? Had you heard?    What?
What?    The marriage!
The marriage!    Well, what does it matter to you?
Well, what does it matter to you?    Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
How was I? Tell me honestly.    You were sublime.
You were sublime.    What did you think of the music?
What did you think of the music?    Extremely clever.
Extremely clever.    Meaning you didn't like it.
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.    Don't bother!
Don't bother!    What?
What?    Don't bother.
Don't bother.    I'll be right back.
Oh - excuse me!    Is her mother still lying on the floor?
Is her mother still lying on the floor?    No, she's fine.
No, she's fine.    I'm so relieved.
Is she a good fuck?    What??
What??    I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?    Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
No! I won't have him back.    But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.    Hardly.
Hardly.    Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.    I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.    Sir -
Sir -    Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.    Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to infer you faithfully.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to infer you faithfully.    And how will you make him keep it?
And how will you make him keep it?    Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.    You have leave to try.
You have leave to try.    Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
Why what, sir?    Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?    Humiliated?
Humiliated?    How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.    I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.    No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.    Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!    Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Who the devil are you? What do you want?    I've come to dinnnnnner!
I've come to dinnnnnner!    Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.    Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!    Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
What is it?    I want to go!
I want to go!    Where?
Where?    I want to go back to Vienna.
I want to go back to Vienna.    Now?
Now?    Yes!
Yes!    Why?
Why?    I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.    What are you talking about?
Stop it!    I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
No! No! No!    Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?    Where?
Where?    We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.    Fartsbishop!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.    Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.    Why not?
Why not?    Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.    That's stupid.
That's stupid.    Why? People fart backwards.
Why? People fart backwards.    Do you think that's funny?
Do you think that's funny?    Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.    Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!    Yes, you are. You're very sick.

No, I'm not playing this game.    No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.    No!
No!    Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!    Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.    Ui-vol-i-tub!
Ui-vol-i-tub!    Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?    What?
What?    Tish-I'm-tee.
Tish-I'm-tee.    Eat
Eat    Yes.
Yes.    Eat my - ah!
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?    Of course.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!    Oh, leave me alone.
Oh, leave me alone.    One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!    They'll come anyway. They love me here.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.    No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.    Oh yes? You always know everything.
Oh yes? You always know everything.    Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!    You borrowed money from your mother?
You borrowed money from your mother?    Yes!
Yes!    Well, don't do that again!
Well, don't do that again!    How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?    Don't be stupid.
Don't be stupid.    All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?    Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.    This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.    Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.    What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?    Tell them to go!
Tell them to go!    Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.    No!
No!    Yes!
Yes!    I love you! I love you!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?    Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.    He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?    Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?    Wolfi!
Wolfi!    What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!    Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
There's a young girl to see you.    What does she want?
What does she want?    I don't know.
I don't know.    Well, ask her!
Well, ask her!    She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.    Oh, damn!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -    Stanzi!
Stanzi!    No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.    Wolfi.
Wolfi.    Yes, my love?
Yes, my love?    These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.    Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!    Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.    What?
What?    Your father is dead.
Half the receipts! Stanzi!    I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
You're not going to do this?    Why not? Half the house!
Why not? Half the house!    When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.    Oh, Stanzi.
Oh, Stanzi.    I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.    Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.    Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.    Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!    Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Who was that?    No one.
No one.    I heard voices.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?    I'm not telling you.
I'm not telling you.    Why not?
Why not?    You'd think I was mad.
No. Don't answer it!    Why?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?    Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.    Give me two more weeks. Please.
Give me one reason I can understand.    I can't write it!
I can't write it!    Why not?
Why not?    It's killing me.
Go back to bed.    Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Excellency!    Madame. How can I help you?
Frau Mozart?    That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.    How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?    He's terribly busy, sir.
He's terribly busy, sir.    I understand.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.    Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.    I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.    I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.    Really?
Really?    My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.    Then he didn't send you?
Then he didn't send you?    No, sir. This is my own idea.
No, sir. This is my own idea.    I see.
I see.    Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.    Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.    That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.    Originals?
Originals?    Yes.
These are originals?    Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
It is miraculous.    Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.    Oh, thank you, sir!
Come back tonight.    Tonight?
Tonight?    Alone.
Alone.    What for?
What for?    Some service deserves service in return. No?
Some service deserves service in return. No?    What do you mean?
What do you mean?    Isn't it obvious?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.    But! I'm a married woman!
But! I'm a married woman!    Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?    What?
What?    Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
What are you doing here?    Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.    Why you?
Why you?    I was at hand.
I was at hand.    Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.    He needs me, ma'am.
He needs me, ma'am.    No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.    He asked me to stay.
He asked me to stay.    And I'm asking you -
This is not his handwriting.    No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.    He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.    Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
How much will you pay him?    Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Am I interrupting something?    Not at all.
Not at all.    Where's our friend?
Where's our friend?    He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.    I hope so. I need it immediately.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?    Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!    I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?    He's doing his best.
He's doing his best.    I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!    You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!    Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?    Money! Money!
Money! Money!    You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.    Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
I see that you're expecting.    Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.    When, may I ask?
When, may I ask?    In three months! Papa.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.    But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!    Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.    And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?    Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!    So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.    Do you hear him? Do you?
Be careful!    Be careful!
He's adorable!    Adorable!
Behold!    Behold!
Hey!    Hey!
Behold!    Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.    I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.    Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!    I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.    Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.    Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Upstairs.    Gertrude!
Gertrude!    You can't be Herr Mozart!
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.    Gertrude!
Gertrude!    It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.    People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.    Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
I said play!    Michael!
What a strange young man.    Yes. He is a little strange.
Really?    Ah, now! Here she comes.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?    I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.    Wine?
Just one year.    Who was your teacher?
Who was your teacher?    I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.    Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.    You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
What a charming idea. May I see?    It's just a trifle, of course.
It's just a trifle, of course.    May I try it?
May I try it?    Majesty.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?    You do me too much honour, Sire.
You do me too much honour, Sire.    Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
A-flat, Majesty.    Ah-ha!
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.    Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
My pleasure.    Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Well, I'm glad to hear that.    Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.    Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.    Your Highness.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!    I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -    Yes?
Yes?    You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.    And the result satisfies.
And the result satisfies.    Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.    Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.    I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.    You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.    Sire.
Sire.    Well. There it is.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.    Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.    Why not?
Why not?    Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.    Oh?
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.    Of course not.
Of course not.    I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.    Really?
Really?    As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!    Yes?
Yes?    Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Do you like this, Salieri?    It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.    Well, look at them.
Your Majesty!    No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
Oh, thank you.    The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.    Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.    Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Majesty!    Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Why so?    Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.    It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Yes, where?    In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.    Ah-ha.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.    What? On one hearing only?
What? On one hearing only?    I think so, Sire, yes.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?    Yes, indeed.
Yes, indeed.    And German?
And German?    Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!    So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?    Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.    What do you mean, Sire?
What do you mean, Sire?    Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.    My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.    Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.    Enchanted, Madame.
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?    Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
Excuse me, but how old are you?    Twenty-six.
Twenty-six.    Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.    Thank you, Sire!
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?    What is it?
What is it?    May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.    Ah! By all means.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?    Yes, Sire.
Yes, Sire.    Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?    Who told you this, Majesty?
Who told you this, Majesty?    It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?    Well, yes, I admit it is.
Well, yes, I admit it is.    Would you tell me why?
Would you tell me why?    Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.    Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.    I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.    Ah, love again.
Ah, love again.    But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?

I have no idea.    Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.    Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!    Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.    You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.    Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?    I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.    Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?    In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Yes, sir.    Well. There it is.
Well, what do you have for me today?    Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -    Yes, what about him?
Yes, what about him?    He's here.
He's here.    Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.    I will.
Why are you here?    Am I not welcome?
Am I not welcome?    Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.    Is she not here?
Is she not here?    I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Do you always live like this?    Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.    Don't you have a maid?
Don't you have a maid?    Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.    How is your financial situation?
How is your financial situation?    It couldn't be better.
It couldn't be better.    That's not what I hear.
That's not what I hear.    What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.    They say you're in debt.
They say you're in debt.    Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!    How many pupils do you have?
How many pupils do you have?    Pupils?
Pupils?    Yes.
Yes.    Yes.
Yes.    How many?
How many?    I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.    Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.    This one will.
What's that?    Oh, let's not talk about it.
Oh, let's not talk about it.    Why not?
Why not?    It's a secret.
It's a secret.    You don't have secrets from me.
You don't have secrets from me.    It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.    Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?    Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.    Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
No, really!    This is just a game, Papa.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!    I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.    But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Papa, is this your idea?    Mine?
Are you playing a trick on me?    I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!    Papa!
Papa!    Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.    No one calls you that.
No one calls you that.    She does. She says I sleep all day.
Father -    Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.    Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.    What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.    I will, sir.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?    Yes, thank you, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.    Bene! Bene!
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.    Bene.
Oh, thank you, sir.    Do any pupils come to the house?
Do any pupils come to the house?    Not that I've seen.
Not that I've seen.    Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?    Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.    Really? What is it he's writing?
Really? What is it he's writing?    Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.    Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.    Yes what?
Where does he work?    In there, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?    I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!    Why? What has happened?
Why? What has happened?    You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.    What medicine?
What medicine?    I don't know. He has pains.
I don't know. He has pains.    Where?
Where?    Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.    Is he working?
Is he working?    I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.    Is he working?
Is he working?    I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.    Opera? Opera!
Opera? Opera!    Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.    Are you sure it's an opera?
Yes?    Are you Herr Mozart?
Are you Herr Mozart?    That's right.
That's right.    My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.    What?
What?    They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?    Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Sssh!    Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!    Sssh! Stay here.
What did he say? What did he say?    Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Well?    Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Sublime! Utterly sublime!    That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?    Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.    I liked the horse.
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.    I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.    'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.

Animals?    I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.    German!
German!    Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?    No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.    So there you are. What do you say?
Leave that alone!    Wolfi!
Wolfi!    Put it down!
Put it down!    What is this?
What is this?    Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.    Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?    What?
What?    What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?    Yes.
Yes.    Can I see it?
Can I see it?    No.
No.    Why not?
Why not?    Because there's nothing to see.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.    Well, we can.
Well, we can.    So let me see it. Where is it?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.    And which one of them do you want me to teach?
And which one of them do you want me to teach?    What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.    Madame.
Madame.    This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
I'm afraid I am.    Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.    Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?    Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!    Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?    Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?    Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.    Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?    What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?    Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?    What for?
What for?    If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.    Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.    No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
I'm sorry. No.    Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.    My answer is no, Mozart.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?    Really?
Really?    Mio caro Adone.
Mio caro Adone.    Ah!
Ah!    A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
Love, Sire!    Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.    But this is absurd!
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.    Did you like it, then?
Did you like it, then?    How could I not?
How could I not?    It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?    Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.    So you are. How is your pretty wife?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?    She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.    I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.    So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.    Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?    I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.    Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!    My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.    Whom did they choose?
Whom did they choose?    Herr Sommer.
Herr Sommer.    Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.    No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.    But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!    An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.    You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?    No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.    It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.    How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!    How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.    They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!

Of course not.    Do you have a daughter?
Do you have a daughter?    I'm afraid not.
I'm afraid not.    Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!

What exactly are you working on?    I can't say. Really
I can't say. Really    I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?    It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.    Really? Why?
Really? Why?    I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?    Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.

With all my heart, Mozart.    Thank you! Oh, thank you.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.    I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.

I have come to commission work from you.    What work?
What work?    A Mass for the dead.
A Mass for the dead.    What dead? Who is dead?
What dead? Who is dead?    A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.

How long will you give me?    Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.    Are you neglecting my request?
Are you neglecting my request?    No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
What happened? Is it over?    I'm taking you home. You're not well.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.    No, no. I have to get back. I have -
Where is your wife?    Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.    You mean she's not coming back?
You mean she's not coming back?    You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.    No, please.
No, please.    I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.    This is only a vaudeville.
This is only a vaudeville.    Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.    Do you mean that?

What?    I'm too young to be so sick.
Shall I answer it?    No! No, it's him!
No! No, it's him!    Who?
Who?    The man. He's here.
The man. He's here.    What man?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.    Finish what?
Finish what?    He knows. He knows!
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?    Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?    Would you? Actually, you could.
Would you? Actually, you could.    My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.    But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.    Of course.
Of course.    You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.    Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?    A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
Where did I stop?    The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.    So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?    Consigned to flames of woe.
Consigned to flames of woe.    Do you believe in it?
Do you believe in it?    What?
What?    A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?    Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.    Strange!
Strange!    Come. Let's begin.
Confutatis Maledictis.    We ended in F Major?
We ended in F Major?    Yes.
Yes.    So now - A minor. Suddenly.
The Fire.    What time?
What time?    Common time.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.    Yes.
Yes.    Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?    I think so.
I think so.    Sing it back.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?    Yes.
Yes.    Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -    Please! Just one moment.
It couldn't be simpler.    First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?    With the tenors.
With the tenors.    Also identical?
Also identical?    Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
And that's all?    Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Do you have me?    I think so.
I think so.    Show me.
That's wonderful!    Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.    Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?    Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.    Yes!
And that's it. Do you have it?    You go fast!
You go fast!    Do you have it?
Do you have it?    Yes.
Yes.    Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
Do you want to rest a bit?    Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.    We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.    I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?    Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?    I'm not leaving you.
I'm not leaving you.    I am so ashamed.
I am so ashamed.    What for?
What for?    I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
Oh? Have I seen it?    I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.    I think you'd better.
You mean in Turkey?    Exactly.
Exactly.    Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?    Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.    But, Your Majesty -
That will do, Herr Mozart!    Just let me tell you how it begins.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.    Certainly, Herr Director.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?    Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.    Exactly. A dance.
Exactly. A dance.    But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.    It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
What are you doing, Herr Director?    Taking out what you should never have put in.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?    Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?    What is what?
What is what?    Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.    Because His Majesty wishes it.
Because His Majesty wishes it.    Is the Emperor angry with me?
Is the Emperor angry with me?    On the contrary.
On the contrary.    Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?    Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.    No, but I'm the best.
No, but I'm the best.    A little modesty would suit you better.
A little modesty would suit you better.    Who is on this committee?
Who is on this committee?    Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.    Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!    Mozart -
Mozart -    They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.    Mozart -
Mozart -    Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!    Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.    Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
Herr Mozart -    May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
I don't think it was really decided, Director.    Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?    Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.    Baron!
Mozart -    Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?

But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?    Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?

Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?    Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?    Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
What do you want?    I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.    About what?
About what?    You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?    So?
So?    In the sight of God that is a sin.
In the sight of God that is a sin.    What do you want?
What do you want?    Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.    Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.    I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.    Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?    That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.    Are they?
Are they?    Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.    I do not seek forgiveness.
I do not seek forgiveness.    My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.    How well are you trained in music?
How well are you trained in music?    I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.    Where?
Where?    Here in Vienna.
Here in Vienna.    Then you must know this.
I can't say I do. What is it?    I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Well?    I regret it is not too familiar.
I regret it is not too familiar.    Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.    I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?    Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.    Ah - you've heard that?
Ah - you've heard that?    All Vienna has heard that.
All Vienna has heard that.    And do they believe it?
And do they believe it?    Is it true?
Is it true?    Do you believe it?
Do you believe it?    Should I?
Do you hear me?    He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.    Did you try?
Did you try?    Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.    You cannot say that!
You cannot say that!    No? Was Mozart a good man?
No? Was Mozart a good man?    God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.    All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to infer Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!

My son, no one can speak for God.    Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!    I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.    Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
What?    His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?

Yes.
Yes.    The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.    I did.
I did.    No, you didn't!
No, you didn't!    I poisoned his life.
I poisoned his life.    But not his body.
But not his body.    What difference does that make?
What difference does that make?    My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?    No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!    Oh my son, my poor son!
Oh my son, my poor son!    Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You infer a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.    Yes?
Yes?    Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.    Italian?
You mean that play?    Exactly.
Exactly.    He's setting that play to music?
He's setting that play to music?    Yes.
Yes.    You must be mad.
Are you absolutely sure?    I've seen the manuscript.
I've seen the manuscript.    Where?
Where?    Never mind.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.    Incredible.
Incredible.    The Emperor has given him permission.
What anger?    About the ballet.
About the ballet.    Ballet? What ballet?
Ballet? What ballet?    Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?    Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?    Yes, in the third act.
Bravo, Your Majesty!    Well done, Sire!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.    Did we?
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?    For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.    Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?    Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.    Ah.
Here I am, my angel.    What? Who the devil are you?
What? Who the devil are you?    I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.    Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.    I can't wait.
I can't wait.    Well, promise then.
Well, promise then.    What do you mean - now?
What do you mean - now?    Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?    Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.    I agree, Baron.
I agree, Baron.    Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?    No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.    How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.    Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.    Who is she?
Who is she?    She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.    Excuse me, my dear.
That lady is back, sir.    Show her in. Then go to bed.
What does he want?    He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.    Come with me. And stay in the room.
Herr Salieri.    Yes, I am looking after him.
Yes, I am looking after him.    Can we come in?
Can we come in?    Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.    But he's all right?
But he's all right?    Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.    Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?    Of course.
Of course.    And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.    Bene.
Bene.    I'll call tomorrow.
I'll call tomorrow.    Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?    Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?    The American? Yes, duck.
The American? Yes, duck.    How did he look?
How did he look?    What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?    You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?    I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.

Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.    Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?    Dr. Hirsch?
Dr. Hirsch?    Go about your duties.
Go about your duties.    Yes, Doctor.
Oh, Miss Price?    Yes, Doctor?
Yes, Doctor?    What exactly did he call out?
What exactly did he call out?    He said 'Jack'.
He said 'Jack'.    That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.    What happened to them?
What happened to them?    The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.    No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Did he say a wolf?    Yes, I believe he did.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.    Come to my office, Miss Price.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.    Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.    It's a full moon. Where is he?
It's a full moon. Where is he?    At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
He's not?    Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?    Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.    Has his friend appeared to him again?
Has his friend appeared to him again?    Yes.
Yes.    What did he say?
What did he say?    David says Jack comes to warn him.
David says Jack comes to warn him.    Warn him?
Warn him?    Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?    I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.    Yes.
Yes.    They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.    And what else?
And what else?    I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?    No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Surely you're not suggesting...    David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?

Dr. Hirsch?    Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.    What shall we do?
What shall we do?    Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
He's here.    Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?    He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.    The zoo? Is he rational?
The zoo? Is he rational?    Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.    Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?    No, why?
No, why?    Is David acting strangely?
Is David acting strangely?    No, not really.
Could you get here without any trouble?    Yes, I should think so.
Yes, I should think so.    Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?    Yes, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor.    You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?    He's fine. We'll come right over.
He's fine. We'll come right over.    Shall I send a car?
Shall I send a car?    No, a cab will be faster.
No, a cab will be faster.    I expect you shortly.
What shall we do?    Tea would be nice.
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.    David?
David?    I doubt it. But it's something to do.
It wasn't a lunatic.    I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?    It was a wolf.
It was a wolf.    What?
What?    A wolf.
Mr. Kessler?    Yes?
Yes?    You haven't eaten your lunch.
You haven't eaten your lunch.    I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.    I'm afraid you have to eat something.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.    Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.    You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.    How is that?
How is that?    Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?    Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.    Sorry.
Aw come on, Miss Price!    Call me Alex.
Call me Alex.    Aw come on, Alex!
Aw come on, Alex!    Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Call me David.    Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?    This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.    Right.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?    Will you give me a break?
You're a very beautiful girl.    I thought you were asleep.
I thought you were asleep.    I was. What are you reading?
I was. What are you reading?    'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.    Do you like it?
Do you like it?    I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
What do you dream about?    I dream of death mostly.
I dream of death mostly.    I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.    It's okay. I want to talk to you.
How old are you?    That's not really a very proper question.
That's not really a very proper question.    How old are you?
How old are you?    Twenty-eight.
Twenty-eight.    I'm twenty-seven.
I'm twenty-seven.    I know.
I know.    Now what do you want to talk about?
Now what do you want to talk about?    Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?    My best friend. My very best friend.
My best friend. My very best friend.    Shall I read to you?
Shall I read to you?    What? Oh, yes, please.
What? Oh, yes, please.    A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?    Yes, go on.
Yes, go on.    Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
Hello. You all right?    I'm sorry I woke you up.
I'm sorry I woke you up.    Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?    No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.    That's easy enough.
That's easy enough.    I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.    David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.    Will you come with me?
Will you come with me?    What?
What?    I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.    Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.    Will you think about it?
Will you think about it?    How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?    Not just a patient -- me.
Not just a patient -- me.    You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?    Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.    All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?    Now I'm embarrassed.
Now I'm embarrassed.    Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
I'm a werewolf.    A werewolf?
Are you better now?    I'll let you know the next full moon.
I'll let you know the next full moon.    You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
My friend Jack was just here.    Your dead friend Jack?
Your dead friend Jack?    Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?    What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?    I was dreaming again?
I was dreaming again?    I would think so.
I would think so.    Yeah, I would think so, too.
The kitchen.    Very nice.
Closet.    Charming.
Charming.    Bathroom.
Bathroom.    Lovely.
Lovely.    The bedroom.
The bedroom.    There is only one bed.
There is only one bed.    David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
It's nice to see you.    It's nice to see you.
Alex?    Yes?
Yes?    Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?    Of course.
Of course.    Good.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?    I was awake and he was in my room.
I was awake and he was in my room.    But, David.
But, David.    I wasn't hallucinating.
Tomorrow is the full moon.    That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.    Do me an enormous favor?
Do me an enormous favor?    Anything.
Anything.    Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.    It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.    Werewolves simply do not exist.
Werewolves simply do not exist.    David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?    Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?    Okay.
Okay.    I've left those pills for you.
I've left those pills for you.    A doper werewolf.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.    See you later.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!    I'm freezing.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!    The zoo?
The zoo?    Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?    Don't you remember?
Don't you remember?    I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
The next corner we can get a cab.    I should be committed.
I should be committed.    Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.    I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
But...    Pull over.
David, what are you doing?    Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.    David, stop!
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...    Jack is dead!
Jack is dead!    Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.    Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.    What?
What?    We had an argument. He's being silly.
We had an argument. He's being silly.    I swear, I don't know this girl.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...    Will you shut up!?!!
Hopeless. It's hopeless.    David, let's go now.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!    David, don't lose control.
David, don't lose control.    Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
Hello, Benjamin.    No.
No.    No what?
No what?    No.
No.    Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.    No.
Feeling better?    No.
No.    The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.    No.
No.    Right.
How are we feeling tonight?    No.
No.    No what?
No what?    No!
No!    Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?    No.
No.    I thought not.
He all right?    Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.    He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.    Chart says he's from New York.
Chart says he's from New York.    I think he's a Jew.
I think he's a Jew.    Why on earth do you say that?
Why on earth do you say that?    I looked.
I looked.    Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Miss Price.    Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.    Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?    Has he been refusing food?
Has he been refusing food?    Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.    Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Officer, I killed those people last night.    You did, did you?
All right, you two, move along.    Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!    There's no call for that kind of language.
There's no call for that kind of language.    Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!    Now see here young man.
Now see here young man.    Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Who is this girl?    You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.    That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?    This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.    Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.    You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.    No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.    Why are you doing this to me?
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?    No, but we're about to.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.    Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.    Oh, come on, tell us.
Oh, come on, tell us.    No. You've had your chance.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.    That's very funny, that is.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!    You could have told them!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.    I was having a nightmare.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.    What time is it?
What time is it?    It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.    Alex?
Alex?    Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.    What are you going to see?
What are you going to see?    An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.    Do you have bad dreams, too?
Do you have bad dreams, too?    Some, everyone does.
Some, everyone does.    Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?    Bambi?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.    Where am I?
Where am I?    You're in a hospital in London.
You're in a hospital in London.    London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.    I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.    The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?    Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!    Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
How long have I been here?    You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.    Two weeks?
Two weeks?    You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.    Lunatic?
Lunatic?    Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
There were witnesses?    So they said.
So they said.    How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.    In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.    Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
You've never had bad dreams before?    Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?    I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.    Yes.
Yes.    Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.    You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.    Did you see Jack?
Did you see Jack?    No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.    Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?    I really don't know.
I really don't know.    Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.    David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.    You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?    Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.    Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Are you cold?    Yes.
Yes.    Good.
Jack.    David.
David.    You're not having a good time are you?
You're not having a good time are you?    Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
Well, I like it here.    I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.    Right.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?    I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.    Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.    She's a jerk.
She's a jerk.    You're talking about the woman I love.
You're talking about the woman I love.    I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.    Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?    I don't know.
I don't know.    Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...    If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.    I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.    It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.    It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.    We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?    She says she 'likes me too much'.
The Slaughtered Lamb?    Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?    That's a wolf's head.
That's a wolf's head.    Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?    That's not a spear. It's a pike.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.    A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.    David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.    I assume full responsibility.
I assume full responsibility.    Okay.
Okay.    Shall we?
Hello.    Nice to see you.
Nice looking group.    Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.    Look at that.
What about it?    It's a five-pointed star.
It's a five-pointed star.    Maybe the owners are from Texas.
Ask them what the candles are for.    You ask them.
You ask them.    Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.    I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.    Right.
Right.    Wrong.
Go on, ask them.    You ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.    What do you mean? I'm starving.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!    Apparently so.
What the hell was that all about?    I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.    Beware the moon?
Beware the moon?    Come on, I'm freezing.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.    I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.    Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
What do you think was wrong?    I have no idea.
I have no idea.    Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.    I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Say, David...    I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Did you hear that?    I heard that.
I heard that.    What was it?
Could be a lot of things.    Yeah?
Yeah?    A coyote.
A coyote.    There aren't any coyotes in England.
There aren't any coyotes in England.    The Hound of the Baskervilles.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.    Pecos Bill.
Pecos Bill.    Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe.    Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.    No, but he was on the moors.
No, but he was on the moors.    It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.    Yeah.
Shit! David, what is that?    I don't know. Come on.
I don't know. Come on.    Come on, where?
Come on, where?    Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's moving.    It's circling us.
What's the plan?    Plan?
Plan?    Let's just keep walking.
It's in front of us.    Do you think it's a dog?
Oh shit. What is that?    A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Nice doggie. Good boy.    Walk away, Jack.
Walk away, Jack.    Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
See anything?    No.
It sounds far away.    Not far enough. Come on.
Jack?    Yeah.
Yeah.    Where are we going?
Where are we going?    I'll tell you when we get there.
I'll tell you when we get there.    Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
You really scared me, you shithead.    Are you going to help me up?
Nice to see you.    Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.    Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot.    This is too much. I can't handle this.
This is too much. I can't handle this.    I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
David! You're hurting my feelings.    Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!    I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.    Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?    Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.    Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.    Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.    I can't stand it.
I can't stand it.    So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.    Rudy Levine the shmuck?
Rudy Levine the shmuck?    Life mocks me even in death.
I'm going completely crazy.    David!
David!    What?!
What?!    David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.    Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?    I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.    If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!    We were attacked by a werewolf.
We were attacked by a werewolf.    I'm not listening!
I'm not listening!    On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.    Shut up, you zombie!
Shut up, you zombie!    I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.    What's wrong with you? Shut up!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!    The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.    Will you be quiet?!
It's you, David.    What?!
What?!    You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.    What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!    Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'    Stop it, Jack.
Stop it, Jack.    Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.    Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.    You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.    You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!    David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.    Nurse!
Nurse!    Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.    Nurse!

The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.    Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!    It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
You're not real.    Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
What are you doing here?    I wanted to see you.
I wanted to see you.    Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.    David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.    I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.    Yes.
Yes.    Get out of here, Jack!
Get out of here, Jack!    David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...    A monster. I know, I know.
A monster. I know, I know.    You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.    Jack, are you really dead?
Jack, are you really dead?    What do you think?
What do you think?    I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.    You must believe me.
You must believe me.    What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!    The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!

Hi, Jack.    Hi, David.
What can I say, Jack?    You don't have to say anything.
You don't have to say anything.    Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?    If I was still alive, I probably would.
If I was still alive, I probably would.    You look awful.
You look awful.    Thank you.
Thank you.    I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.    What about the zoo?
What about the zoo?    Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.    I want you to meet some people.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.    Hello.
Hello.    Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Because this must be stopped.    How shall I do it?
I could hang myself.    If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Dr. Hirsch?    Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
No, thank you, Doctor.    Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
You were saying?    Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?    Why don't we ask him?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...    Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
What can we do to assist you?    Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Yes?    Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.    Send them in.
Excuse me.  Yes?    Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.    What here?
What here?    He's on the telephone.
He's on the telephone.    Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
Hello, there. What can I get you?    Campari and soda would do nicely.
Campari and soda would do nicely.    Sorry, love.
Sorry, love.    I suppose Guinness will suffice.
What's that?    Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.    I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
Do you have any hot soup?    No.
Hot chocolate?    We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.    Then you have some hot tea?
Then you have some hot tea?    No.
No.    Oh.
Oh.    But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Remember the Alamo?    I beg your pardon?
No, thank you.    I'd like some tea, please.
Sorry.    Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.    Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.

Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...    And what, Sergeant?
And what, Sergeant?    I don't rightly know, sir.
I don't rightly know, sir.    That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.    We'll find him, not to worry.
Hello, Tom.    You here again? What do you want?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!    Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?    I want to know why .
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest    I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.    But listen, Tom, I
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.    She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.    Why not?
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?    Yes - sure
Yes - sure    Yeah - sure!
Oscar, what's the matter?    I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.    No kidding?
No kidding?    No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.    Where's Matt?
Where's Matt?    Matt?
Matt?    Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .    The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.    He has?
He has?    Yeah.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.    How much?
How much?    About twenty-four thousand.
About twenty-four thousand.    It was more than that last week.
It was more than that last week.    Yeah.
Yeah.    Here's twenty-five thousand.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?    Yeah.
Yeah.    Let me have ten bucks?
Let me have ten bucks?    Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.    Charlie!
Charlie!    Yeah?
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I    Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Whose death?    It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.    Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?    Aw, nerts!
Where you been?    Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
What's the matter, Charlie?    I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.    I remember once when your account checked.
I remember once when your account checked.    Yeah.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.    Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Mr. Dickson in yet?    Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.    When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.    Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.    And tell him not to delay.
And tell him not to delay.    Yes, sir.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.    Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!    Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust    What good will that do?
What good will that do?    What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!    Take it easy, Clark.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.    All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything    I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.    Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?    Just pure luck!
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?    Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.    I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!    Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!    Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
We want to talk to you.    What about?
What about?    We'll discuss that in the board room.
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?    What do you mean, help?
What do you mean, help?    I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.    That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?    I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?    Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.    No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.    So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
Say, you can't do that    I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.    The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!    We've been waiting fifteen minutes
We've been waiting fifteen minutes    You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.    Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?    Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?    That's very simple. I was home.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.    Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.    Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?    If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.    Oh!
Oh!    You understand?
You understand?    Why, of course.
Thanks.    "Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming ""Mother Machree."""
"Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming ""Mother Machree."""    "It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings ""Mother Machree"" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time."
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.    All right, Jack, all right.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.    Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?    They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!    Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.    I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!    Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.    He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?    I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.    What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?    Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!    Fifty thousand dollars!
Fifty thousand dollars!    But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?    Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.    You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?    She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't    Get out, get out!
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?    I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!    That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.    I haven't got it.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.    I'm sorry, Dude, butI
I'm sorry, Dude, butI    That don't do us any good.
That don't do us any good.    But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.    We can take blood from anything   If it's comin' to us.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I    Why not?
Why not?    Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !    You don't have to do nothing.
What do you mean?    All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?    You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.    know, but
know, but    Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?    But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?    Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .    Why, I needed a
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?    Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .    Me?
Me?    Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.    For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .    Well, you can. You always could.
Well, you can. You always could.    Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks    What is?
What is?    running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!    If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.    Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.    Line?
Line?    Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.    But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.    Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Doesn't that come next?    Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?    See, we're getting along famously!
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.    Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.    Well
Well    Well, what?
Well, what?    Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?    You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.    Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.    Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.    No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.    Why are you so anxious?
Why are you so anxious?    Don't you know?
Don't you know?    No.
No.    I want to be near you!
What?    Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?    Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...    I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.    Why, Cyril, you're insane
Why, Cyril, you're insane    No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer    Cyril!
What's this?    My apartment.
My apartment.    I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.    Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.    No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.    What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?    No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.    Good for you. Come on.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.    Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.    What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]    A misunderstood bachelor.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.    I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!    I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Why, Matt!    What are you doing here?
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?    Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.    Let me see your cash book, will you?
Let me see your cash book, will you?    Now?
Now?    Yes, now.
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.    Oh, yeah?
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.    I'm listening.
I'm listening.    It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.    Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
I'm not interested in what you think.    You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.    I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.    No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.    This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?    That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!    I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.    John, how's your wife this morning?
John, how's your wife this morning?    Much better this morning, thank you.
Much better this morning, thank you.    Got a handkerchief?
Excuse me    Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?    I'm feeling fine this morning.
I'm feeling fine this morning.    That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.    Thank you!
Shall we let the people come in?    Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.    Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.    Hello, darling.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!    It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.    Oooh! That has the earmarks!
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?    Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.    Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?    Yes.
Yes.    I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.    But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.    I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.    Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.    The theatre?
The theatre?    That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?    Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.    You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn    The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Ho! Ho! Ho!    Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.    Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .    Well . . .
Well . . .    Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?    Tomorrow night?
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.    Happy now?
Happy now?    No.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?    Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .    Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?    In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Good morning.    Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?    I don't know.
I don't know.    Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?    Why - well, I
Why - well, I    Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?    Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.    Directors, eh? Long faces?
Longer.    I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.    Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!    Where is he now?
Where is he now?    In Mr. Sampson's office.
In Mr. Sampson's office.    Now don't you worry about it.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.    Yes, sir.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?    Numbers? No, never mind.
Good morning, Helen.    Good morning.
Good morning.    Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Oh!    Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Yes?    Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?    Yes, sir.
Yes?    Mr. Sampson . . .
Mr. Sampson . . .    All right. Send him in.
Helen!    Yes?
Yes?    Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.    Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.    Got my letter?
Got my letter?    Yes, thank you.
Yes, thank you.    Hello, Helen.
Mr. Dickson?    Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.    Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?    I haven't any.
I haven't any.    You haven't got a uniform?
You haven't got a uniform?    No, sir.
No, sir.    My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?    Why, I don't know.
Why, I don't know.    You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Oh, make that uniform blue.    Yes, sir.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?    Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.    Looks good. How much did it cost?
Looks good. How much did it cost?    I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
It's all right. Thanks.    And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.    Sure, I think it's swell.
Sure, I think it's swell.    Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.    Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?    Well, I
Well, I    I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
I already told him I was home.    There you are.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?    I can't tell you.
No. I won't.    You're protecting somebody.
You're protecting somebody.    No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!    Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.    Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?    You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?    Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?    Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?    Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?    Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is    Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?    Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .    She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?    Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and    All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!    But I haven't . . .
But I haven't . . .    I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.    Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.    I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.    Why pick on him ?
Why pick on him ?    It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?    Yes.
What time did this thing happen?    The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.    All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?    If he can do it, yes.
If he can do it, yes.    Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.    Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.    What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.    Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.    So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they
Of course it's true - and he knows it.    Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.    Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.    He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?    No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
You're lying!    Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.    You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
Well, Sampson, what is it?    Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.    I'm afraid he's been stalling.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.    That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .    He says he can't get away in the daytime.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.    How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.    Yes, sir.
The lobby's half filled now.    What are you talking about?
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.    All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.    We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.    Yes, sir.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.    Did you get the case for the securities?
Did you get the case for the securities?    Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.    Mine too?
Mine too?    Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.    What'll we do?
What'll we do?    I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.    Don't you think I know it?
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!    Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.    Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.    I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.    Is it safe?
Is it safe?    Absolutely.
Absolutely.    It's his life insurance money, you know.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.    But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!    Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.    Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Is that busy husband of mine busy?    He's at a board meeting.
He's at a board meeting.    Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.    I'm afraid so.
I'm afraid so.    Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?    No.
No.    Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?    Hardly.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!    All right.
Hello, Helen!    Matt, come here!
Matt, come here!    Why?
Why?    Come here, honey!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!    Oh, is that so?
What did you do with it?    With what?
With what?    The ten dollars.
The ten dollars.    Oh, ten dollars
Oh, ten dollars    Yes.
Yes.    A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
No.    Oh, you think I'm lying?
Oh, you think I'm lying?    Yes.
Yes.    All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.    Oh, Matt.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?    Yeah, swell.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?    Yeah.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.    Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.    Well . . . ?
Well . . . ?    Well, he was making love to her.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.    I tell you, I saw them!
In Cluett's office?    Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
What's keeping you?    Oh, Charlie again.
Oh, Charlie again.    Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?    Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]    Oh now, don't be silly.
Oh now, don't be silly.    Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.    Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.    Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.    All right, dear.
Oh, Matt . . .    Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?    Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.    They must have turned him down.
They must have turned him down.    Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.    Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Did you talk to him?    Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.    Mr. Williams . . .
Mr. Williams . . .    The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?    Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Did you say Dude Finlay?    Yes, why?
Yes, why?    He was in the bank yesterday.
He was in the bank yesterday.    He was here?
He was here?    He came to see Mr. Cluett.
He came to see Mr. Cluett.    Are you sure?
Are you sure?    Yes, sir.
What did you find out, Mike?    I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.    Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?    He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.    Dude Finlay?
Dude Finlay?    Yes, sir.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?    Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
for the rheumatism, you know.    What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?    It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
What time was it?    Huh?
Huh?    What time did Matt Brown get in?
What time did Matt Brown get in?    Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after    I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?    That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .    Was it twelve o'clock?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...    It couldn't have been earlier?
It couldn't have been earlier?    No. It wasn't earlier because...
No. It wasn't earlier because...    Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.    No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.    There you are!
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it    That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?    wasn't anywhere near this place
wasn't anywhere near this place    Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?    I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!    You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Then who changed it?    I don't know.
So you were home last night?    Yes.
Yes.    What time did you get in?
What time did you get in?    Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.    Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?    Yes.
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .    Then where were you?
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.    Okay, Matt.
How are you fixed?    I'm okay, Matt.
I'm okay, Matt.    You've got enough?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.    Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?    Bought himself a pocketbook!
Everybody in?    I guess so.
I guess so.    Where's Charlie?
Where's Charlie?    Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!    They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
You can ride like that?    I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
I think I may just go on to the reservation.    Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
I couldn't lose him.    Jim Younger, I told you--
This is healing?    Sometimes a wound will kill.
Sometimes a wound will kill.    Now you tell us.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!    Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
He's smiling.    Never a good thing.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.    Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.    That was two hours ago.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.    Zee, I'm pleased you came.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.    The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.    I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.    Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
Uhh, yeah it does.    You stay out of this, Bob.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.    How?
How?    "Say we bust into a bank. We yell ""We're the Younger-James Gang!"" People are gonna be thinking, ""The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?"" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms."
We got a problem here, brother?    Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.    What?
This is the best score yet.    It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.    That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.    As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.    Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.    Leave me alone, Bob.
How'd they --    What have you done?
What have you done?    I ain't done --
I ain't done --    WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Bob. I didn't...    Swear.
Swear.    I swear --
I swear --    Swear on Jimmy's grave.
I'm sorry, Cole.    You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
"Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says ""Let's ride."""    He's not bad at it.
He's not bad at it.    It's tougher than it looks.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.    I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Yesterday.    Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Corn gonna shoot at me?    Nope.
Nope.    Then I love it.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...    ... Will Perry ...
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.    Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.    Oh no...
Oh no...    He just lost his temper a little.
Damn!    They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --    The Army can hang him.
The Army can hang him.    Tomorrow.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.    Best damn plan I heard all war.
How many of them did he kill?    Two.
You have no shame.    Not yet. But I'm hoping.
But if we take their money and supplies...    Exactly.
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.    Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.    We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
"""The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."""    Hey!
Hey!    """Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."""
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...    One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Beg pardon?    You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
"This is about the ""Wanted!"" Posters, isn't it."    Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...    You are a fine figure of a man.
You are a fine figure of a man.    Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.    He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's been full of vinegar lately.    He's planning a job.
He's planning a job.    What?
What?    Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...    Tell me.
What?    You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
What you sayin' boy?    I think I recognize you.
I think I recognize you.    How?
How?    I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
You shut up now, boy.    No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
'Bout time you got here, buddy.    What's going on?
Ride with me, cousin?    I could use the walk.
I could use the walk.    Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
Where you boys going?    There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.    Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Hands off your hip, Cole.    You're not scared, are you?
You're not scared, are you?    Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
Not now.    What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?    In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?    She got two of them.
She had a moustache.    She was European!
She was European!    All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
Thanks for the help.    After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?    The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.    It was exciting.
It was exciting.    But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.    Yeah.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.    So what do we do, General Lee?
So what do we do, General Lee?    Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.    Perfect, Cole.
Perfect, Cole.    Let's ride.
The James-Younger Gang.    Sorry.
Sorry.    Don't let it happen again.
I got seven thousand.    I got three.
See, Frank's being smart about this.    Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
It's not a bank.    It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
"""The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."""    Twenty?!
Jesse, we got to have a word.    Sure, cousin.
Sure, cousin.    "All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the ""James-Younger Gang."""
"All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the ""James-Younger Gang."""    Yep.
Yep.    "Why aren't we the ""Younger-James Gang""? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here."
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.    Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
It'll be the biggest score yet.    What will be?
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.    If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.    What are you saying?
What are you saying?    I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.    You're forgetting who's in charge --
Beautiful.    Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --    A bad idea.
A bad idea.    I got us through the War all right.
I got us through the War all right.    And almost got hanged in peacetime.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.    That's it.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.    And I'm the better outlaw.
Still smells fishy.    Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Fine. We hit this bank.    You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Dammit!    A trap.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.    Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Bob, rip up some bandages.    Pass me some whisky.
We'll make them pay for this.    I'm out.
I'm out.    WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!    Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Missed you, cousin.    Missed you too, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --    Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Where'd you get all these riders?    We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.    You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!    You ride like a Comanche.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.    Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...    Well?
Well?    I'm thinking...
Cannon or Gatling?    Both would be nice.
Both would be nice.    Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
What the --    Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
I think one of 'em's glass.    Which one, right or left?
Which one, right or left?    The brown one.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...    Sadie was not a man!
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.    Shakespeare.  He's European.
Shakespeare.  He's European.    Ah.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!    Get buckets!
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --    Strategically.
Strategically.    -- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Jesse.    Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?    Cole, he didn't mean that.
Another dozen out back.    They gonna rush us?
They gonna rush us?    They're just insurance in case we run.
The safe. Now.    Of course!  Uh, sir?
Of course!  Uh, sir?    What?
What?    Where is Jesse James?
Where is Jesse James?    This here is the Younger Gang!
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!    All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
You 'um big lawman?    Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?    Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.    The District Marshall
Of St. Louis?    Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.    East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?    Ho-yah!
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!    Me get heap firewater --
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!    You're right, sir.
You're right, sir.    Then why can't I go in there?
Then why can't I go in there?    On account of we're robbing it.
On account of we're robbing it.    Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?    It's a secret.
It's a secret.    Fine. I'll just wait here.
Fine. I'll just wait here.    I'd appreciate that.
What the --    What is it?
What is it?    Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.    So?
So?    When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
Where the hell were you?    I had you covered.  From back there.
I had you covered.  From back there.    Shit.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.    My little Web did that?
My little Web did that?    Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
Web died fighting?    Died a hero.
Boys...    Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
What do you say, sir?    Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
You know you're welcome any time!    Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.    It's fine by me, Jesse.
Daddy, don't start with this again.    Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?    The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
They're gone. What are you --    I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.    Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.    I think he's already feeling better.
He thinks this is some kind of game!    I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.    So we got a plan?
Distracting enough for you?    Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.    So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.    Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.    Such as?
Such as?    You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.    That would have made an impression.
That would have made an impression.    I figure.
I figure.    See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.    No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Web's dead.    I reckoned.
I reckoned.    Hell of a war.
Hell of a war.    I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!    All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.    We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Frank, don't you have something to say?    You're doing just fine.
You're doing just fine.    Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.    Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.    Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.    What kind of story are they going to believe?
That just might work.    Maybe, maybe...
"""Big and older""?"    You can shut up now.
You can shut up now.    You are a charmer.
You are a charmer.    I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.    "Next time try ""fat and haggard."""
She's still talking to Jesus.    What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.    "Your Zee? Hmm.  ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."""
You know him?    Heard of him.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.    Damn. All that reading paid off.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?    What do you think?
What do you think?    Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --    Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.    Ma.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.    Don't care.
Don't care.    Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.    Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
How'd it go in there?    Fine. How'd it go out here?
Fine. How'd it go out here?    We're gonna have to talk...
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --    And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.    And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?    It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.    Bob's upset.
Bob's upset.    The posters?
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!    Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
This has been a good year.    Jesse, we're outlaws.
Jesse, we're outlaws.    And we're good at it.
And we're good at it.    It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.    You've killed your fair share of men.
You've killed your fair share of men.    If I could go back to farming --
If I could go back to farming --    That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.    I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.    We're doing this for Ma.
We're doing this for Ma.    Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Maybe it started out that way. But now...    What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.    A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
We're drunk.    Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.    Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?    No, I --
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.    Got any ideas, little brother?
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.    Jim was old enough...
Jim was old enough...    He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?    Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.    You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.    Yeah.
Yeah.    A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?    I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.    See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.    Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...    Yeah, Jimmy?
Yeah, Jimmy?    ...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.    I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.    Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.    That he was.
That he was.    They're making him a hero now.
They're making him a hero now.    Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.    But he killed a lot of men, too.
But he killed a lot of men, too.    Can't argue that.
Can't argue that.    So what was he?
So what was he?    I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
Uncle Frank?    Yeah Jimmy?
Yeah Jimmy?    How much of that story is true?
How much of that story is true?    Everything but the boring parts.
Did you kill Yankees?    A fair number, Ma.
A fair number, Ma.    Say your prayers?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.    He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Easterners.    We're just fine, thank you, sir.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.    Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Ma! Please!    Boys?
Riders --    We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.    Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Doc Mimms will --    Shush.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?    You were little Jesse James when you left.
You were little Jesse James when you left.    But you got big!
But still died.    If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Jesse, are you awake?    Mmmm.
Jesse, is that your hand?    Nuh-huh ...
You shouldn't be up.    I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.    You're sick of my company?
You're sick of my company?    No! I mean, of course not. No.
No! I mean, of course not. No.    Teasing you is completely unfair.
Teasing you is completely unfair.    What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.    I shouldn't tease a hero.
I shouldn't tease a hero.    What?
What?    Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.    I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.    So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?    Unfair. You are completely unfair.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.    You didn't want to farm?
You didn't want to farm?    I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.    A river pirate.
A river pirate.    Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.    Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?    Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.    You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?    Not if I find the right girl.
Not if I find the right girl.    And what's this right girl like?
And what's this right girl like?    Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.    Where will you find such a girl?
Where will you find such a girl?    Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
"Ahem. ""From this doctrine..."" No, ah... ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."""    Sparkling rocks?
Sparkling rocks?    Little ones.
Little ones.    Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?    Yep.
Yep.    Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?    I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
I am so sorry, Jesse.    Frank and me have to go away for a while.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.    Me neither.
Me neither.    Let the law --
Let the law --    Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.    Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?

Zee.    Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!    I had to see you. I'm getting married.
I don't understand.    She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.    That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...    She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.    That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.    Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?    I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.    Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
Hmm.    """Hmm"" what?"

We're moving you tomorrow.    But I like the presidential suite.

Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.    So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?    That's the idea.
Did you order our houses burned down?    Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
You almost ended my career before it began.    Pity.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?    Last February?
Last February?    Mmm.
Mmm.    You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?    Yes?
Yes?    The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.

Was it worth it?    Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.

You cocky little bastard.    Ahh, you'll miss me.
Ahh, you'll miss me.    No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.    He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.    Thanks.
Thanks.    I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.    Fair enough.

Right here in church?    Communion.
And you're too young.    I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.    And the same age Web was. No.
I like that.    No.
You okay, Jesse?    Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.    Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.    I guess so.
I guess so.    I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?    Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
Well, not exactly.    You been with a girl ever?
You been with a girl ever?    Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?    I think so.
I think so.    You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?    I swear.

Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.    You do that.
What about that Rock Island bastard?    It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
... too young for whisky...    This time we'll make an exception.
This time we'll make an exception.    Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...    You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
Why, yeah.    I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.    Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.    Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
Really?    I hope I'm not being too forward.
I hope I'm not being too forward.    Not at all.
Not at all.    I just though you were awful cute.

Lyla Devereux.    Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?    Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.    Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?    That is so gentlemanly of you.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.    Really?
Really?    Don't talk about it much, though.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.    I'm doing you folks a favor --
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.    It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.    They had to be dealt with!
They had to be dealt with!    By burning down their homes?
How can that be?    They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
There's only four of them...    Move you fools!
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.    And it is my pleasure to be here.
And it is my pleasure to be here.    Really!
Really!    NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
NO!

I can completely understand your distress, sir.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.    Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.    Good.
Good.    Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.

Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.    Yes sir.
Yes sir.    Just perfect.
Just perfect.    A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.    You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.    I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.    I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.    How much did they get from the safe?
How much did they get from the safe?    Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --    I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!    To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.    THEN WHO DID?!
THEN WHO DID?!    We did.
Your men knew the risks.    What is going on here, man?
With my money!    We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
The final route for the railroad is complete.    I look forward to seeing it.
Parker.    Sir?
Sir?    What is that?
What is that?    What, sir?
That.    Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
This is him.    I remember you.
How did you know?    Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.    Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
You wouldn't have done that?    Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.    I want them arrested and hanged!
I want them arrested and hanged!    Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.    This is no game.
This is no game.    I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
"""A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."""    It is a nice piece of writing.
It is a nice piece of writing.    """The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!""  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!"
"""The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!""  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!"    Oh, that's the best part.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.    I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!    Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.

So you can't tell me anything?    It's going to be a long winter.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.    All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.    I can't believe this.
I can't believe this.    And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.    I demand action.
I demand action.    No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?    Can't you tell me anything?
Can't you tell me anything?    It's going to be a long spring.
So he's won.    No.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.    In English, Pinkerton.
In English, Pinkerton.    There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.    Can you put men at all four?
Can you put men at all four?    No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.    What is that?
What is that?    Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
What the hell is that sound?    Vengeance.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?    What? Oh, I'm...busy.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.    Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?    Stop it. I'm...
Stop it. I'm...    On a lot of lithium?
On a lot of lithium?    Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.    You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?    Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?    Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.    Pumpkin?
Pumpkin?    Yes?
Yes?    Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.    Uh huh.
Uh huh.    Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.

I know. Stop it.    Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.    Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.    Courtney? Dinner?
Courtney? Dinner?    I can't.
I can't.    I'm thinking Dorsia.
I'm thinking Dorsia.    Dorsia's nice.
Dorsia's nice.    Nice?
Nice?    You like it there, don't you?
You like it there, don't you?    The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.    Okay. Yeah. What time?
Okay. Yeah. What time?    Eight?
Eight?    Pick me up?
Pick me up?    Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.    Is that Donald Trump's car?
Is that Donald Trump's car?    Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.    You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.    I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
J&B. Straight.    Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.    Are we here?
Are we here?    Yes.
Yes.    This is Dorsia?
This is Dorsia?    Yes, dear.
"Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish."" You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely."    Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Luis is a despicable twit.    Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
"No, you idiot. I said ""Is it a receptacle tip?"" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me."    Is it a what?
Is it a what?    Pull out.
Pull out.    I'm ignoring you.
I'm ignoring you.    Pull out, goddamnit!
Pull out, goddamnit!    What do you want, Courtney?
It's a plain end. I think.    Turn the light on.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.    Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.    It's a plain end, see? So?
It's a plain end, see? So?    Take it off.
Take it off.    Why?
Why?    Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!    Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?    Oh God, just get it over with.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?    Maybe.
What are you doing tonight?    Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.    That's nice.

You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.    Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?    Yes, Courtney?
Patrick?    Yes?
Yes?    Nothing.
I haven't seen you around here.    You just haven't been looking.
You just haven't been looking.    Would you like to see my apartment?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?    I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.    Do you take American Express?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?    Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...    Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.    I don't think so.
Nothing like last time, promise.    Alright.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?    Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.    Really?
Really?    My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.    Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
This is nicer than your other apartment.    It's not that nice.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.    Do...what.

No-I can't take the time off work.    Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.    I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want to talk about it.    Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.    Because I...want...to...fit...in.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.    Hi. Pat Bateman.
Why don t you just go for Price?    Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?    He's rich.
He's rich.    Everybody's rich.
Everybody's rich.    He's good-looking.
He's good-looking.    Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.    He has a great body
He has a great body    Everybody has a great body now.
Are you using minoxidil?    No. I'm not. Why should I ?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?    Your hairline looks like it's receding.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.    It's not.
I want a firm commitment.    I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Why? What's wrong?    My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
We need to talk.    Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?    It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over    Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?    I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.    But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.    I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
You're really serious, aren't you?    Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.    But what about the past? Our past?
But what about the past? Our past?    We never really shared one.
We never really shared one.    You're inhuman.
You're inhuman.    I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
No, no, no.    I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.    Oh God, I can't believe this.
Oh God, I can't believe this.    I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
Where are you going?    I'm just leaving.
I'm just leaving.    But where?
But where?    I have to return some videotapes.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .    What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday    Good coloring.
Good coloring.    That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?    Nice.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?    I know her. I knew her.
Because he dated her.    How did you guess?
How did you guess?    Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.    Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?    Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?    No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Listen, what about dinner?    "Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? ""What about fucking dinner?"""
Are you my two o'clock?    No.
Can I help you?    I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Doesn't he live here?    No, he doesn't.
No, he doesn't.    Are you sure?
Are you sure?    You saw the ad in the Times?
You saw the ad in the Times?    No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?    There was no ad in the Times.
I think you should go now.    But I think...I want to know what happened here.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.    Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Don't come back.    I won't...don't worry.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.    Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?    Yes, naturally.
Yes, naturally.    Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?    What exactly do you mean?
What exactly do you mean?    The message you left.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?    But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Carnes? Wait.    Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.

Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.    What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?    Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...    Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.    Excuse me. I really must he going.
Excuse me. I really must he going.    No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer    But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.    It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?    It's just not.
It's just not.    Why not, you stupid bastard?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.    No, you...didn't?
No, you...didn't?    Now, if you'll excuse me.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?    Lucky, I guess.
Lucky, I guess.    That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?    Uh huh.
Uh huh.    It looks so soft.
It looks so soft.    Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Patrick? Is that you?    No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.    This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?    Commes des Garcon.
Call me please, Patrick.    Jesus lives, Luis.
What...is...it?    Where are you going?
Where are you going?    I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.    Patrick?
Patrick?    What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?    It looks that way, doesn't it?
That's Paul Owen.    That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-    I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.    Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?    Maybe it's just the light.
Maybe it's just the light.    Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...    What?
What?    It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.    I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
SHUT UP!    Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Calm down. Let's do it anyway    I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.    Like what?
Like what?    Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
What's that, a gram?    New card. What do you think?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.    But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...    Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.    Ask me a question.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.    Leaving what?
Leaving what?    This.
Don't, I'll drink it.    Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.    Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?    I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!    Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?    No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.    Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?    I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Dorsia.    Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?    Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Dorsia, yes?    Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
We are totally booked.    Oh really? That's great.

That is...if you're not doing anything.    Oh no. I have no plans.
Oh no. I have no plans.    Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Anywhere you want?    Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.    Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.    No, come on. Anywhere you want.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.    Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.    Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...    Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.

Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.    No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?    Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Do you have a boyfriend?    No, not really.

Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.    You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.    No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?

0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?    Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.    Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
I mean they want to get caught.    Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.    Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?    Not really.

Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.    Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
I'm so hungry.    It's cold out, too, isn't it?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?    I'm so hungry.

I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.    I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.    Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?

Shhhh...it's okay.    Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.    Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.    I can't...I can't find a shelter
I can't...I can't find a shelter    You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?    I've been great. And you?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?    It's...it's...all right.
It's...it's...all right.    Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?    Oh well, you know.
Oh well, you know.    And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.    Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.    Yeah, well, you're late.
Yeah, well, you're late.    Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.    We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.    Nobody goes there anymore.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?    I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?    Cecelia is, well...you know
Cecelia is, well...you know    Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.    Another Martini, Paul?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.    Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?    No, man. I'm gonna bail.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.    Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?    They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Hey, Halberstam?    Yes, Owen?
Yes, Owen?    Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?    No, Owen.
No, Owen.    Is that a raincoat?
Is that a raincoat?    Yes, it is.
You think so?    You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.    Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?    What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.    I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?    Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
Is it over?    They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.    You are a fanatic.
You are a fanatic.    'Gonna wait outside.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.    """Make"" him?"
"""Make"" him?"    You know what I mean.
I'm just screwed.    You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.    You don't wanna move, do you?
You don't wanna move, do you?    I can paint anywhere.
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --    Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.    C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --    Then you've gotta ask him about that.
It's important.    If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.    Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.    But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.    I think that's great, Milo. I do.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.    ...But?
...But?    Didn't you visit the campus?
Didn't you visit the campus?    I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.    No way. You have this -- destiny.
No way. You have this -- destiny.    C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --    Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?    You saved my life in alot of ways.
When's Brian coming for the TV?    Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
That took some fun out of --    We're not gonna let it.
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?    Milo! What about --?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?    That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.    "He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, ""Did you really do this just today?"" Cause I was impressed. He said ""What're you implying?"""
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.    What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?    That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
He's your boss. He's not your --    I know, I know.
I know, I know.    If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.    Isn't that -- extreme?
Isn't that -- extreme?    What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --    You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
What!    Teddy was killed last night.
Teddy was killed last night.    What're you -- what?
What're you -- what?    It was a hate crime.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.    I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.    I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.    "I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says ""Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?"" It's like they know what every kid's doing."
"I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says ""Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?"" It's like they know what every kid's doing."    They hack into people's programs?
They hack into people's programs?    Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.    You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.    Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.    """Like this?"" It's Gary you're talking about."
"""Like this?"" It's Gary you're talking about."    You think I don't know that?
You think I don't know that?    Milo. Why would he --
Milo. Why would he --    "How should I know? ""Solving a problem,"" I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there."
"How should I know? ""Solving a problem,"" I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there."    Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --    It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.    Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --    I can't just walk away!
I can't just walk away!    You can't just walk in, either.
You can't just walk in, either.    They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.    Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.    ...Whaddo I do?
...Whaddo I do?    So you believe me?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?    Nothing.
Nothing.    Nothing?
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.    ...Why?
...Why?    Remember Lyle Barton?
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --    I remember.
I remember.    After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.    Guilt?
Guilt?    If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.    Poor baby. You know that's not true.
That was -- different.    ...Different?
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.    Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Look at this.    What?
What?    Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.    He has thousands of employees, Milo --

It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --    Milo --
Milo --    I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.    Milo, you --
Are you gonna tell me where you went?    I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --    Just shut up?
Great!    Look at me! I'm gonna change.
You look beautiful.    Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.    ...What?
...What?    I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Milo?    Don't we have any chopsticks?
Don't we have any chopsticks?    Oh, right. Hold on.
Here we go.    Great.
...wanna savor this.    It's gonna get cold.
It's gonna get cold.    Right. Wait. A toast.
Right. Wait. A toast.    You're just afraid to eat it.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?    No.
No.    Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?    He'll tell me when he gets home.
He'll tell me when he gets home.    That'll be a test, won't it?
That'll be a test, won't it?    Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.    Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.    Prick.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.    He wasn't acting?
He wasn't acting?    I don't think he knows how.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.    Right... What's that mean again?
Right... What's that mean again?    Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.

It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...    Like I said: shot in the dark.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?    ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?    Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.    Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Milo?    Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.    Have a seat.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.    I am. I am, sir.
Milo?    My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.    My goodness.
My goodness.    It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?

Well I parked illegally. See y'later?    'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.

Will I get to work for Outpost?    No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.    What?
What?    What'd they ever do for you?
Okay.    Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --    What?!
What?!    Wanna be a part of history?
You're interfaced with our dish.    Gimme the coordinates?
Is it your software?    Is it your dish?
What?!    He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
...When did you know?    You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
That's gotta kill him, right?    Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.    Outpost doesn't own em.
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.    That'd change with a criminal indictment.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.    There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.

Milo? I'm Danny.    Oh hi.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?    He's pretty tight with his family.
He's pretty tight with his family.    We could move 'em up here.
We could move 'em up here.    He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
Who's that?    "I think they call him the ""Houseman."" 'Cause ""guard"" sounds too weird."
...Hello?    Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.    You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
Cool!    Would you like a Coke or something?
Would you like a Coke or something?    Oh. No thanks.
You know a lot about art, I guess.    There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.    Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.    Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?    Skywire.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.    It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?    You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --    I do!
I do!    Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.    Okay. I'm Gary.
'Think I should buy some originals?    ...Do I?
...Do I?    Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.    That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.    That's what I told her. My wife.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.    Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
How's it going?    Maybe I'm going too fast.
Maybe I'm going too fast.    Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
It's okay. Really.    Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
You did this -- overnight?    You're making me young again.
Milo. What's up?    Well -- you sent for me.
Well -- you sent for me.    Right... Right.
You really wrote this just today?    What're you implying.
What're you implying.    Nothing!
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?    I'm sure.
I'm sure.    The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
It scales, don't you think?    Definitely.
I heard what happened.    Were the flags for Teddy?
Had you talked to him much lately?    Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.    Did you?
Did you?    Talk about work? Never!
Talk about work? Never!    I meant did you find other stuff to --
I meant did you find other stuff to --    Oh. Yeah.
Oh. Yeah.    You've been coming in early.
You've been coming in early.    It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...    34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.    The wrong place?
The wrong place?    The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
Gary, hi.    You look a little tired.
You look a little tired.    I'm okay. It's going well!
I'm okay. It's going well!    'Have a look?
'Have a look?    Sure.
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.    "...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a ""system."" ""Losers,"" who played games of chance. He could ""read"" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again."

You had to come up with a good story, right?
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.    ...Worse?
...Worse?    "Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  ""Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world."" The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one."

That's great! Thanks.    'Sorry about the late notice...

Gary, I --    You see what's hanging on the wall?
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.    I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.    I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
This is good. Who did it?    'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.    Maybe we should all get on it.

I think you should go.    You do?
You do?    I mean, it's your life.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --    You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.    Just thought his work should go on.

Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.    We'll come up with the next big thing.
We'll come up with the next big thing.    ...You wanna work -- here?
...You wanna work -- here?    Got out of my other commitment.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?    Cool.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?    Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?    Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
Every entry was authorized.    Keep looking.
Keep looking.    What're we looking for?
What're we looking for?    Any irregularity in the pattern.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.	Let's get him in here.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?    They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
You calling Phil and Randy?    I'm calling Gary.
Come with me.    Where we going?
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!    I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
Lisa.    You know my name.
You know my name.    You know mine.
You know mine.    You're famous around here.
You're famous around here.    I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.    I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.    ...Were you?
...Were you?    We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.    Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?    ...Something like that. Yeah.
...Something like that. Yeah.    Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
Did I say something?    No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
What've you got there?    Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.    Show me.
Cool!    Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Did you wanna be alone?    No. Please.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?    """There is no second place."" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?"
"""There is no second place."" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?"    Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.    Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?    Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.    You're compulsive.
You're compulsive.    Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.    Why's that?
Why's that?    Long story. Not that interesting.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?    Then and now.  But not right now.
That's great. I -- didn't know.    She saved my life.
I snuck into #21.	Why would you do a thing like --
Why would you do a thing like --    You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.    The Day Care?
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.    But why would they --?
But why would they --?    "You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make ""sense."" I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much."
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.    Oh yeah?
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.    They'd frame him.
They'd frame him.    He's out of prison?
He's out of prison?    "They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his ""act of revenge."""
...Milo?    Hmm?
Hmm?    I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.    No, no. Never.
What about the FBI?    They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.    Who can we trust?
Who can we trust?    There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
Do we post it on the Net?    There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.    Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.    We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.    Certainly not at my happy home.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.    "What about ""60 Minutes."""
"What about ""60 Minutes."""    "Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  ""CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."""

But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --    "Say there's just one ""mole"" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?"
Time?    "Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  ""GE joins Outpost in new venture,"" which means NBC is out. ""Disney joins Outpost,"" ABC is out. ""Outpost and Newscorp in new deal,"" Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!"
How close are you?    What?
What?    He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.    A what?
A what?    It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.

But they'd still get the idea, right?    You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?    It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.    Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.    Before they kill somebody else, too.
Before they kill somebody else, too.    Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.    You mean -- break in?
You mean -- break in?    I don't know --
I don't know --    And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
Why were you so careless?    I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
Why were you snooping in my office?    Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?    'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
I told Teddy about you.    What'd he say?
What'd he say?    """A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"""
"I felt guilty. 'Cause I ""owed so much"" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --"    Gary.
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.    The dishes are juiced up, too.
The dishes are juiced up, too.    Thank God.
Thank God.    Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.

Oh.    Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?

Why?!    She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.    Please don't go.
Please don't go.    At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Meet me at the other location.    Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!

Maybe it's the satellite.    Let's try #2.
...He knows.    What?
What?    He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.

We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.    Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.    What?!
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.    Jesus, Teddy.

Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.    We know all that, Exposition.
We know all that, Exposition.    I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.

Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.    Right away, Exposition.
Right away, Exposition.    Where is Vanessa, by the way?
She's working on another lead right now.    Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.    Thank you, Basil.
Thank you, Basil.    Oh, and Austin...
Oh, and Austin...    Yes?
Yes?    Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.    Oh, yes. Thank you.
Oh, yes. Thank you.    There's one more thing, Austin.
There's one more thing, Austin.    Yes?
Yes?    Be careful.
Be careful.    Thank you.
Hello, Exposition.    Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.    Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.    What's the other?
What's the other?    Excuse me?
Excuse me?    What's the other thing you're scared of?
What's the other thing you're scared of?    Carnies.
Carnies.    What?
What?    Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.    Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.    Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.    Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
My God, Austin, what have you done?    That's not your mother, that's a man!
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.    Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!    You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.    I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.    I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?    Yes, Basil?
Yes, Basil?    Be careful.
Be careful.    Thanks.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.    I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.    Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!    Austin, I have something for you as well.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.    Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--    Yes Basil?
Yes Basil?    Be careful!
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.    Hey, Mick!
Hey, Mick!    Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?    Well, you can't always get what you want.
Well, you can't always get what you want.    """You can't always get what you want!"" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit."
"""You can't always get what you want!"" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit."    Good on ya, man.
Good on ya, man.    Groovy!
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...    Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.    Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.    Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?    That does not compute.
That does not compute.    Why not? It's a question.
Why not? It's a question.    Love is... love is... love is...
What's wrong with your hand?    Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.    Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?    No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
I've got you, Dr. Evil!    Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.

We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.

Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.    That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.    Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.    Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.    Man, you are one chilly square!
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.    Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.    My mother's told me all about you.
My mother's told me all about you.    If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?    My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.    Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.    My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?    I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...

Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?    I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?    I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.    Excuse me?
Excuse me?    My wedding tackle.
My wedding tackle.    I'm sorry?
I'm sorry?    My meat and two veg.
My meat and two veg.    Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.    Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?    A Chigro?
A Chigro?    You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.    We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.    That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.    Sure.
Sure.    Do I make you horny?
Do I make you horny?    What?
What?    Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?    I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.    Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.    I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!    Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.    No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.    Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.    I'm sure.
I'm sure.    I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.    Here, use mine.
Here, use mine.    I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
I can't see a bloody thing.    Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
Why did you leave so soon?    That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?    Do you want to talk to him?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.    Why?
Why?    We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
A limousine has just pulled up.    Let me see.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.    How do you know?
How do you know?    I never forget a pussy... cat.
Let's go get him!    He's too well-protected right now.
He's too well-protected right now.    We can't just sit here, Austin.
We can't just sit here, Austin.    Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'

I don't get it.    Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.    Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.    No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I hate having my picture taken.    You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
Fancy a nibble?    I couldn't have another bite.
Watch out, you're on my hair!    Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.    Go! Just go!
I haven't had fun like that since college.    I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.    Why?
Why?    I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.    No, this is me in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.    I am not.
I am not.    Oh, yes you are.
Oh, yes you are.    I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
I can't. You're drunk.    It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.    She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
Really, Austin!    Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Austin, may I have a word with you?    Of course, luv.
Of course, luv.    Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.

I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.    I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?    Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.    No, did you use a condom?
No, did you use a condom?    Only sailors use condoms, man.
Only sailors use condoms, man.    Not in the Nineties.
Not in the Nineties.    Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.    Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.    It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.    You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Hello, luv.    Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.    Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.    Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.    Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.    I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?    Do you think she's prettier than I?
Do you think she's prettier than I?    Who?
Who?    You know who.
You know who.    No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.    I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.    Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.    Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Does that make you horny?    Not now, Austin.
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?    Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.    No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.    Smashing idea! Give it to me.
Not a good time to lose one's head.    Indeed.
Indeed.    That's not the way to get ahead in life.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.    Yes.
Yes.    It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.    Shut up.
Shut up.    Fair enough.
What do we do now?    We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.    I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.    Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.    I'll hurry back.
I'll hurry back.    Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--

Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.    Oh, behave!
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.    Likewise.
Likewise.    I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...    I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.    Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!    Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?    Don't worry!
Austin, I'm coming with you.    I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.    I'll secure the perimeter.
I have something to tell you.    Lay it on me.
Lay it on me.    I love you, Austin.
I love you, Austin.    That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.    Kiss me.

Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?    Sure.
Everything seems to be in order.    Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.    Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do.    Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.    No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.    I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
Noooooooooooooo!    Where did you learn to shoot?
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.    Is it one of ours?
Is it one of ours?    No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.

Oh my God, he's back.    In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.

But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.    Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...    And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;    Silence!
Ahhhhhhhhh!    Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
We've got a lot of work to do.    Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.    Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.    Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.    You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Ow! You shot me!    Right. Okay. Moving on.
Right. Okay. Moving on.    You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?    Yes.
Yes.    Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.    My son?
My son?    Yes.  Scott!
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?    Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.    These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Quite impressive.    Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.    I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.    Dr. Evil?
Dr. Evil?    Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.    It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.    Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
What is it now?    Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.    I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?    Sea bass.
Sea bass.    Right.
Right.    They're mutated sea bass.
They're mutated sea bass.    Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?    Please allow me to demonstrate.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?    Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.    Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.    We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.    The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.    That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
Hi.    Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.    I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?    Not me.
An evil vet?    No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.    An evil petting zoo?
An evil petting zoo?    You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?    Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.    Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?    Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.    And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?    Yeah. What?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.    Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?    In due time.
In due time.    But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?    I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.    Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.    One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.    Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!    No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.    I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.    No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?    I don't want to.
I don't want to.    Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?    Blow me.
Blow me.    What did you say?
What did you say?    Show me.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!    I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.    I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.    Scott, don't say that...
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.    Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.    "People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a ""laser.""  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the ""Ozone Layer."" Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom."
Umm, that also has already happened.    Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.    All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.    Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?    Great.
Great.    How's Austin?
How's Austin?    He's asleep.
He's asleep.    You didn't...
You didn't...    Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
I'm proud of you.    Why?
Why?    Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.    You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.    What about his teeth?
What about his teeth?    You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.    I just don't see it.
I just don't see it.    Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.    Did you ever...
Did you ever...    Of course not. I was married to your father.
Of course not. I was married to your father.    Did you ever want to?
Did you ever want to?    Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.    I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.    I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.    I love you, Vanessa.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?    Well, it's kind of weird.
Well, it's kind of weird.    We don't judge here.
We don't judge here.    OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.    And how do you feel about that?
And how do you feel about that?    I don't wanna take over the family business.
What do you want to do, Scott?    I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
We don't label people here, Scott.    No, he's really evil.
No, he's really evil.    Scott.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.    "OK, Scott, no one really wants to ""kill"" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it."
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.    Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.    Really?

He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.    So I'm still ...
Would that I could say the Same.    Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --    You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?    Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
You    Have we met?
Have we met?    You mean you don't recall??
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.    Promised? Who promised?
Promised? Who promised?    There, look!
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!    Sir August...?  What now?
May I help you, madam ...    Mr. John Steed, please.
Mr. John Steed, please.    I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm afraid that's impossible.    Impossible?
You are female?    As you see.
As you see.    Then you can't come in.
Then you can't come in.    I have an appointment.
I have an appointment.    No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.    Really -- what happened in 1922?
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?    Eh? In here!
Quite a collection.    If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...    We have met ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.    This isn't a game.
This isn't a game.    Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.    Rules are made to be broken.
Rules are made to be broken.    People, too.
People, too.    Then who wins?
Then who wins?    You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...    Hmmm ...
Hmmm ...    Looks like rain, Steed...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --    Let me guess -- 'Father'?
How curious ...    Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.    Ropes?

I resign.    You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.    Watch me.
What are you trying to do to me?    We want to help...!
We want to help...!    I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.

The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...    To you ... ?

The Institute ... the funding ...    A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Who?    Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?    To find out who killed my husband.

About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...    Next assignment?
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...    Thank you, Steed.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.    Thanks, Valentine ...

Think of this as your second wedding feast ...    I'm already married ...

Valentine, listen to me ...    Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.    Ring?
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...    You're mad.
You're mad.    Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --

Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.    The result would be ...

Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...    Then what's stopping you?
Then what's stopping you?    One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.    How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.    Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.

Doctor Peel, I presume?    And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.

... Showers followed by sunny periods.    We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.    A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
My father always wanted a boy.    Really?  I fail to see the connection.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.    I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Do you?    Yes indeed. I need protection.
I thought we were on our way.    Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.    Or half cocked.
Steed, we really must be --    Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...    Thank you, Trubshaw ...
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...    Do you really think so?
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?    Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
But why? What's the point?    A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.

After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?    No thanks.
No thanks.    I meant me.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...    An eccentric recluse?
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.    June, July ... August?
June, July ... August?    The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.    Any other vices?
Any other vices?    All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?    Small talk.  Try the weather.
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?    You should be dead.  How do you feel?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?    Strange.
Strange.    You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.    I wasn't about to.
I wasn't about to.    I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.    I might say the same.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.    Why should they think that?
Why should they think that?    You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.    Frankly that's how I remember it.
Frankly that's how I remember it.    But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.    Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.    That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.    Did he say who?
Did he say who?    No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?    Did you say formal? I must dress.
I must say, you look more your old self --    You mean my other self ...
You mean my other self ...    Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?    I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.    How on earth can you tell?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...    Very good, Steed ...
What on earth?    Any ideas?
Any ideas?    Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...    Is that written in his shoe?
Is that written in his shoe?    Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...    She had this in her mouth. There, there...
For you, Mrs. Peel.    Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
But    Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Not quite. This is my field.    Is there anything that isn't?
Is there anything that isn't?    The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...    Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?    Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...    But if someone miniaturized the process...
But if someone miniaturized the process...    That's what we were working on.
That's what we were working on.    Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Three agents killed by bad weather...    ... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...    Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...    ... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?    Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?    According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Is that what you think?    Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Do you always drive this fast?    Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?    Barely.
Barely.    You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
This must be the last straw.    Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.    Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.    I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Steed ... !    Mrs. Peel ... ?
Where am I?    The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...    Was I?
Was I?    I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...    It was Peter -- I saw him ...
You followed me.    Orders.
Orders.    To kill me?
To kill me?    Nothing personal.
I could save you the trouble.    No trouble.
No trouble.    Because you always obey orders ...
Because you always obey orders ...    Always.  Except ...
Yes ... ?    ... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
And do you trust me?    I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...    It wasn't me; you have my word.
Mmm ... what are you doing?    Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?    Is that all?
But you did suspect me.    Not for a moment.
Not for a moment.    You're playing games.
You're playing games.    Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?    I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you played by the rules.    I thought you didn't.
I thought you didn't.    I'm playing to win.
I'm playing to win.    Winning isn't everything.
Winning isn't everything.    Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.    After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
No, after you.    You don't trust me?
You don't trust me?    As far as you trust me.
I told Mother I took care of you.    You lied.
You lied.    I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?    No idea who. No idea why ...
No idea who. No idea why ...    Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...    ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.    Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?    Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.    I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.    Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Why's he called 'Invisible'?    You'll find out.
Aren't you coming?    I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...    Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --    You didn't tell her?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.    Have we been invited?
What's that you're wearing?    It's called Black Leather.
It's called Black Leather.    Intoxicating. Here, have one of these.
What is it?    Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.    When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.    You first.
You first.    Shall we?
Trubshaw again? What now?    Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.    'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?    Have a look at this.
I'll be back ...    Where are you going?
Where are you going?    Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...    You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.    No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.    But --
But --    Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.    If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
Mrs. Peel?    What kept you?
What kept you?    The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'    '... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'    A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...    Still a bit chilly ...
Still a bit chilly ...    English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...    Have you any place in mind?
Have you any place in mind?    As a matter of fact I have ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.    It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.    Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Our little paradise -- just made for two?    Not quite.
Our chaperon.    Pity your mother came, too ...
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?    Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.    I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.    You're saying I have no choice.
Where's Mother?    Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
You don't believe him?    It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.    Decontamination -- ?
Decontamination -- ?    And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.    I see.
I see.    Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.    Peter's brother?  But --
Peter's brother?  But --    Half-brother to be precise.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...    I know all this.
I know all this.    Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?    Surveillance? By whom?
Surveillance? By whom?    Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.    Who's now vanished.
Who's now vanished.    Makes two of us.
Makes two of us.    Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
I was getting to it.    Getting to what?
Getting to what?    The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --    I fail to see --
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...    Well, I can't possibly go like this.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...    ... and now?
Privately owned by ...    Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.    Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...    I shall need a small plane.
I shall need a small plane.    You're not venturing alone, surely.
You're not venturing alone, surely.    I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...    Global warming?
Global warming?    Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.    So you say ...
Oh, hello ...    We want Mrs. Peel.
We want Mrs. Peel.    Dead, I'm afraid.
Steed    How did you guess?
How did you guess?    You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...    It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'    Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Mother. I thought you were burglars.    Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Weather's turning nasty.    You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.    Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.    Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Think she really killed those agents?    She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.    Amnesia?
Amnesia?    Possibly. Split personality ...
Possibly. Split personality ...    Insane ... ?
Insane ... ?    Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.    Why?
Why?    She may try to kill you.
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.    How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.    Anyone particular in mind?
Anyone particular in mind?    You.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...    Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.    Impossible.
This man -- did you see him?    No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?    Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --    Guilty until proven innocent?
Guilty until proven innocent?    Mother and Father know best.
I was hoping you could tell me.    You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.    I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.    Where?
Where?    In your operation.
In your operation.    I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
Are you alright, young man?    I think so, thank you so much ...
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.    I feel sure of it.
I feel sure of it.    I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?    She was ...
You with Mother or Father?    Both, actually.
Both, actually.    Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.    You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
Wonderland Weather Ltd.    This way ...
Mrs. Peel -- ?    Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...    No, please! I beg you ...
No, please! I beg you ...    Walk over to the window ...
Walk over to the window ...    Let it be rain, please let it be --
Let it be rain, please let it be --    Stay by the window. By the window.
John Steed.    Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.    The last one you'll ever see.
The last one you'll ever see.    Perish the thought.
You're better than I expected.    I was at Harrow ...
I was at Harrow ...    But did they teach you this?
Bang-bang ... you're dead.    You wish.
One shot -- for emergencies.    That's not playing by the rules.
That's not playing by the rules.    Rules are made to be broken.
Rules are made to be broken.    If you say so.
If you say so.    I do.
You said ... one shot.    Did I? My mistake.
Aren't you forgetting about something?    You are, and it's behind you.
You are, and it's behind you.    Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?    Ugh ...
What's happening?    Debbie's marrying Rick.
Debbie's marrying Rick.    ...Really?
Does Cole know about this?    Really -- you went with him for two years.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.    Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.    Check out the other guy's buns.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.    Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Bobbie, what are you talking about?    O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.    He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.    No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?    They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.    What do you mean?
What do you mean?    I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.    You're kidding.
You're kidding.    Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
That's what we're going to find out...    I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.    Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?    Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.    Yeah. What is it?
What?    You're kidding.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.    Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.    Chulo, one thing at a time.
Chulo, one thing at a time.    Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.    Women!
Hey, you guys, what's going on?    We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.    Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
I've decided not to run for President.    Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Man, you're losing your audience.    Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.    Hey, man, congratulations!
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?    Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.    I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.    What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
All right!    When do the girls get to the party?
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.    I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
And...    Bond... James Bond.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?    I want Debbie.
I want Debbie.    Cole...
Cole...    You dump her and I'll give you cash.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.    What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?    Five thousand dollars.
Five thousand dollars.    No.
Seventy-five hundred.    Not interested.
Not interested.    Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...    I'm marrying Debbie.
I'm marrying Debbie.    Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...    What is this person's story here?
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.    He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.    Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
Rick, I want to talk to you.    Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
I don't want any trouble.    Oh, come on, just a little.
Oh, come on, just a little.    I'm ready to make you another deal.
I'm ready to make you another deal.    Ooh, be still, my heart.
Ooh, be still, my heart.    See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
Great car.    The best.
The best.    I love that car.
I love that car.    I'm very happy for you two.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.    The car for Debbie?
The car for Debbie?    I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.    Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.    So does Debbie.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!    Maybe it had something to do.
Maybe it had something to do.    Shit!
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.    Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?    You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?    She's mine!
"He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: ""24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!"" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters."    Fan out and look for them.
Hello?    Mr. Thomerson.
Mr. Thomerson.    Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?    Yes I did.
Yes I did.    Fine. How's everything going?
Fine. How's everything going?    Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Hi, everybody. Am I late?    Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?    Sure have...
Nice shot.    Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.    I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.    Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir, I am.    Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.    I've tried to change her mind.
I've tried to change her mind.    It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.    But how can I do that?
But how can I do that?    If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
Thanks for the advise, sir.    Keep me informed.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?    What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.    Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.    Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.    Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?    The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...    Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?

All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.    Yes, sir.

Cole, we've got to talk.    Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?    No, Cole, I...
No, Cole, I...    It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.    Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...

You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...    Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.    You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?    I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.    Cole, I'm sorry, I...

I'm going now, Cole.    I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
God, you're a slob.    But a fabulous cook.
But a fabulous cook.    What are we having?
What are we having?    It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.    I think your dinner's burning.

Are you going to have women at your party?    No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.    I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.    Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?    Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Huh? Wha...    I can't sleep.
I can't sleep.    Oh... I got something for that.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.    What's the matter?
What's the matter?    I don't know... I just feel scared.
I don't know... I just feel scared.    About what?
About what?    The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...    I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.

That feels so great.    Good...
Good...    Um... that's very relaxing.
Um... that's very relaxing.    Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.    You better not have too much joy.
You better not have too much joy.    Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...    Gonna get married...
This is it, lady. Last stop.    Can't I just go with you guys?
Can't I just go with you guys?    Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.    Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...    You're really pissing me off.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.    Your mother's not dead.
Your mother's not dead.    Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.    Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.    I love you.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.    How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.    Why don't you get undressed.
I can't trust you!    C'mon, I knew it was you.
C'mon, I knew it was you.    Rick, you're lying!
Let go of me!    Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.    The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.    I don't want that. I want to be with you.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.    And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.    I am committed. I love you.
I don't believe you.    You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?    Yes...
Yes...    Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?    Let's get naked.
Let's get naked.    You're on.
Are you okay?    Yeah.
Yeah.    This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?    You're so romantic...
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.    Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.    Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?    Ilene, Rick promised...
Ilene, Rick promised...    Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
Are you sure this is a good idea?    Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.    That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.    Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Let's go.    Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!    Ilene, are you crazy?
Ilene, are you crazy?    I know what I'm doing... Go!
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.    Great, Mom.
Why is Cole here?    You know your father enjoys his company.
A strange wang right in my palm.    Ilene, we don't really know that.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.    Quiet, Mother.
I hope Ilene's all right.    I hope those guys are all right.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.    My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?    A real turd.
A real turd.    Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Great bathing suit.    I think I screwed that one once.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.    Any time, Al.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.    Let's see your bread.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.    They'll be up there in a half hour.
They'll be up there in a half hour.    Okay. Nice to meet you both.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?    What are you talking about, asshole?
What are you talking about, asshole?    Your whores never showed up.
Your whores never showed up.    They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.    Screw you!
That's it, prick lips.    What are you...
What are you...    I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?    Why?
Why?    Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.    Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Give him the works.    That's more like it.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.    Gary, you're quite an animal.
Gary, you're quite an animal.    Screw you...
Let's go.    Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?    All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?    Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.    Let's have a toast.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.    What's going on?
It's true.    This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.    Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.    I'm going to see what the hell happened.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.    Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.    Screw that.
Hookers beat you up?    Yes.
Yes.    I didn't know you were into that.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?    Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.    This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
What can I be doing for you?    You're a pimp?
You're a pimp?    I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.    I want women.
I want women.    That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.    I'll take some.

Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.    Milt?
So, Larry, how have you been?    Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.    Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Larry, you and your wife got problems?    I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
Is that all the coke in the place?    That's it.
That's it.    Good.
You want to share it?    Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.    Right.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.    Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.    She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?    What do you mean, it changes?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.    C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.    I just want to be alone.
I just want to be alone.    "All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after ""Falcon Crest."""
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.    No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
You okay?    Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, I guess so.    Really?
Really?    Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
What the hell are you doing?    I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.    You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?    I couldn't find any razor blades.
I couldn't find any razor blades.    Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.    Ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.    No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.    It's Bullwinkle.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...    It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Are any of those right?    This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?    Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
It's on the tenth floor.    What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.    I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
You're all under arrest. Open up!    Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Oops!    All right, who serves?
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.    Can't I just maim it a little?
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.    Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.    I'd love that.
I'd love that.    Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.    Mr. Thomerson, I...
Mr. Thomerson, I...    Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...    Feel free.
Feel free.    First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Welcome, welcome, one and all.    Rick!
Rick!    Oh, no!
The end.    No sob story is going to change my mind.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...    Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.    No. Let's at least finish the set.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?    In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.    You can tell a man by his friends.
Ed... you're kinky!    The phone made me do it!
The phone made me do it!    You've been having strange sex...!
You've been having strange sex...!    No, Brett, I...
No, Brett, I...    It's all right...  So have I.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?    Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.    Mrs.?
Mrs.?    I'm separated.
I'm separated.    Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?    Of course.
Where'd she go?    She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Where the hell is he?    Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
What's the matter?    Nothing... Let's get crazy!
"We'll spend an hour with ""Nymphos Without Pants""..."    Olivier's in that, right?
Olivier's in that, right?    Then it's on to the real thing.
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.    This isn't right.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?    Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.    I'm not really hungry.
I'm not really hungry.    C'mon. I insist.
What the hell is that?    My gift to you.
My gift to you.    Under the table!
Under the table!    The best table in the house.
I think you'll enjoy this table.    So long, Father.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?    I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Rick, I'm concerned.    About what?
About what?    This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.    Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.    I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.    Oooooo.
Oooooo.    Right in there, pal.
Right in there, pal.    If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.    That's the old Rick!
How'd it go?    Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.    I'm proud of you, lad.
Who was that?    I don't know.
I don't know.    What's this?
What's this?    Got me.
How 'bout this?    Still drawing a blank.
He look familiar?    Very.
Very.    C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Now, don't get into any trouble.    Take care.
Hey, you guys...    Who's your friend?
How about this, a Trojan donkey.    And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
What are you going to do about it?    What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.    I'll stop him... You stall him.
Reach out and snort someone.    I'm saved. Let's party!
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.    Who?
Who?    Debbie.
Debbie.    My Debbie?
My Debbie?    What's with her costume?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.    You got it.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.    Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.    True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?    You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.    Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.    Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.    Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.    Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?    Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.    Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.    Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
You're late again, Rick.    I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.    There can be no excuse for tardiness.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.    You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.    Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.    Right... Think it over.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?    I don't know.
I don't know.    What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.    Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.    I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?    Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Oh these moments do try me...    Be gentle.
Wash it to the windows?    No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.    It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.    Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.    Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?    No.  I need a drink.
You know Knowlton pretty well?    Yeah...
Yeah...    Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
Biggest in two battalions.    We're gonna be okay, man...
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.    It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.    -- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.    Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Let me take the lead, Stephen...    Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...    -- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.    They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
-- Knock it off!    -- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?    There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!    Stevie... I...
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.    My Lt. might have something to say about that.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.    Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.    John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
Is he...    He's alive.
Did you do it for Tim?    That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
You gotta let me finish --    Just come down, John. Just --
Just come down, John. Just --    -- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
-- He killed people --    -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --    -- Stephen, this is bullshit --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --    -- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
It doesn't go like that.    Who asked you?
Who asked you?    If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?    I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.    So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.    Not likely.
Not likely.    Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
I like what you've done with the place.    It's comin' along... want a beer?
Been ripping off fire stations?    It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.    What, you've never seen one before?
What, you've never seen one before?    In the Field Museum once.
In the Field Museum once.    It works.
It works.    It worked when you were in sixth grade.
People actually used to pay you for this?    Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.    Sheep don't count.
Sheep don't count.    Yeah? What about Laura --
Yeah? What about Laura --    That was never proved.
Why'd you come here, Brian?    "I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother ""you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed"" games?"
"I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother ""you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed"" games?"    What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.    Hey! You don't know me --
Hey! You don't know me --    I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?    So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?    Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.    Thanks for the speakers.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...    Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.    I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.    I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Ya love it, probie?    I'm in heaven, Lt.
I'm in heaven, Lt.    Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.    -- C'mon, Stephen.
-- C'mon, Stephen.    -- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Goddamn it Stephen!    -- I told you to stay next to me!
-- I told you to stay next to me!    -- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!    What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...    -- Never mind.
Thanks.    Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Hey.    Hey.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?    Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.    C'mon, let's crawl home.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...    This?
This?    Yeah... too bright...
Roll the hose.    What, are you kidding? By myself?
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.    You got a problem with drilling, probie?
You got a problem with drilling, probie?    No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.    Roll the hose.
Ready?    Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...    Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
You okay?    I waited... I would have fucking waited...
I waited... I would have fucking waited...    That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.    Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?    You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.    Thanks for the insight.
Thanks for the insight.    Brian, look --
Brian, look --    Just leave me alone, okay?
...Not now, Brian.    Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?    I had that fire. He didn't listen!
I had that fire. He didn't listen!    He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.    Fuck you.
Hey, what are you doing here?    Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Just... Just wanted to say hello...    So hello.
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.    You're selling dad's boat?
You're selling dad's boat?    Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...    I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.    Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.    Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --    -- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
It's okay, Stephen, I --    -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
I saw it.    Saw what?
Saw what?    When dad died, I saw another fire...
When dad died, I saw another fire...    Everybody did.
Everybody did.    I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.    ...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?    I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...    Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.    Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?    I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --    -- What are you doing here?
-- What are you doing here?    I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!    I know.
I know.    How do you know?
How do you know?    I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.    -- What were they doing there?
-- What were they doing there?    They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
Anything else?    What are we going to do about this?
What are we going to do about this?    I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.    We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.    I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?    Shut up!
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?    """You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"""
"""You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"""    Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...    I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Brian.    Jennifer.
Jennifer.    You're back.
You're back.    You look great.
You look great.    Thanks for calling.
Thanks for calling.    Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.    Huh.
Huh.    So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.    Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.    Yeah? What have you been up to?
Yeah? What have you been up to?    I work for city hall.
I work for city hall.    Really? No kidding.
Really? No kidding.    What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.    I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
With grenadine, right?    When I was twenty.
When I was twenty.    Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.    Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?    Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.    Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?    Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --    -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.    Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.    Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.    I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.    C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.    Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.    So now you suddenly care about my future?
So now you suddenly care about my future?    Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.    Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.    ...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.    Yeah...
Arson.    Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
Hey.    How's it going?
How's it going?    Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.    Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.    I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
I could use a date.    Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Hi.    Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?    If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...    Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?    You think that's really any of your business?
You think that's really any of your business?    Well, you did invite me here.
Well, you did invite me here.    Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
Okay.    Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?    No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.    Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.    Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.    But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.    In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Thanks for the invite.    Got anything to drink in there?
Got anything to drink in there?    Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?    Homey.
Homey.    See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?    Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.    When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.    Then why did you quit?
Then why did you quit?    I wanted to be a good one.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.    Uh huh.
Brian. What's wrong?    You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.    I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --    -- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --    Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --    -- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.    I was doing my job.
I was doing my job.    "Yeah? And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""?"
"Yeah? And just how much of all this has been ""doing your job""?"    Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --    Leave Stephen out of this --
Leave Stephen out of this --    Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --    -- I work for the city.
-- I work for the city.    You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Hi.    Hi.
Hi.    We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --    Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.    I don't know anything about it.
I don't know anything about it.    You could check. It'd be in his files.
You could check. It'd be in his files.    Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Do you know what you're asking me to do?    Yes.
Yes.    Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?    Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
What is --    Just take it.
I'm sorry.    That's a dumb thing to say.
That's a dumb thing to say.    You're right.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.    I quit two days ago, Brian.
I quit two days ago, Brian.    What'll you do?
What'll you do?    I don't have the slightest idea...
I don't have the slightest idea...    I'll see ya around, huh?
I'll see ya around, huh?    It's a small town.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?    Hey, do I know you?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...    So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?    Who's doing this?
Who's doing this?    Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?    Then who --
Then who --    -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.    I don't have a story.
I don't have a story.    Sure you do.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?    What?
What?    You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --    I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.    Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!    -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...    Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.    The outlets.
The outlets.    That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.    Trychticholorate.
Trychticholorate.    Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
Who the fuck is doing this?    After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Oh Jesus Christ...    Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.    You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?    I want another shot, Sir.

No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.    Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.

Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.    Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Are you still here?    Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.    Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.    I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.    Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
Where are you going?    Pest control.
-- Shhh.    What are you listening to?
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.    Glass?
Glass?    Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...    -- Another backdraft.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.    No it couldn't.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...    I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...

Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.    Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.    And the putty around the door?

What?    I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.

What the hell are you doing here?    I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?    Fire.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.    Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...    And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.    Nice bunch of guys.
Nice bunch of guys.    Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.    Yeah? Airtight?
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.    Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.

Yeah.    Did I say thanks?
Did I say thanks?    No.
No.    Just wondering.

So what do you want me to do?    I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Your brother was a good man.    Yeah.
Yeah.    Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.

Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.    Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?    Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?    Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.    You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Yeah. Big fan.    And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.

I have a job.    This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.

Mr. McCaffrey...    Nice boat.
Nice boat.    It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?    Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Completely out of control.    What the hell are we waiting for?

Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.    Backdraft.
Do you have to do that?    Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.

When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go...

Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!    It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --    Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.    They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.    Susie's not a virgin anymore.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.    She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.    Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.    I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?    What's to believe?
What's to believe?    That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
People.    You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?    Yeah.
Yeah.    OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!    Why?
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.    Who?
Who?    Those fucking Mob assholes.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?    Yeah.
Yeah.    Then c'mere. I got something for you.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?    Nah...
Nah...    Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...    Who?
Who?    A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...    You mean you could use it.
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!    """The Strawberries""?"
"""The Strawberries""?"    The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?    I'm a Catholic.
You took the chalice.    Yes.
Yes.    You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.    Yes.
Are you all right, honey?    I was gonna bring it back myself.
So what are you doing here?    He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.    That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.    What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?    The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.    Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
How are you doing, man?    Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?    Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.    I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.

Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!    I forgive you.
I forgive you.    Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
I forgive you.    Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.    I forgive you.
Large?    All right, cop. I want my money.

He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --    You've really got a problem.

Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?    Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.    Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to infer God?    It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.    I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to infer God?
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to infer God?    I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.    As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --    Yes, Sister?
Yes, Sister?    Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to infer Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.    You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.    How 'bout...

Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.    I'm tired of waiting.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?    Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.    We was coming to see you.
We was coming to see you.    If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?    We're starving.
That ain't funny.    DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.    Well do something about it.
My tap shoes.    EUREKA!!
What do I have to do?    Some tap dancing, some singing.
Some tap dancing, some singing.    Where do I sign?
How different?    Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.    DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!    That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
I would like to change your name.    To what?
To what?    You're now Mantan.
You're now Mantan.    Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.    Why?
Why?    You have to start getting into your character.
Mantan?    Mantan!!
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.    How you sound?
How you sound?    I won't do it anymore.
I won't do it anymore.    Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.

I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.    No costume.  No blackface.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?    Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.

No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.    No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?    Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?    But the line has to be drawn.
But the line has to be drawn.    Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.    Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?    Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.    I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry I'm late.    Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?    I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
Four minutes ago.    So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?    I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?    C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.    I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.    Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
"I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know ""niggers"" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I."    I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.    NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.    I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.    I'm telling you it's not.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...    ...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.    I've never been given a fair shot.
I've never been given a fair shot.    You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.    "I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some ""nigger"" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?"
"I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some ""nigger"" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?"    "That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know ""niggers"" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water."

I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.    You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?    Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.    It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.    I'm wid it.
I'm wid it.    I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.

If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.    Go on.  Good so far.
Go on.  Good so far.    I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
Word!!!    So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.    The name of the show?
The name of the show?    It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.    I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
I'm feelin' dis'!    It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.    Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?    I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.    Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
That's a great handle.    Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.    I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.    What are there character traits?
What are there character traits?    Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.    Exactly!
Exactly!    Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.    And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?    Yep, you guessed it.
Yep, you guessed it.    "This could be bigger than ""Amos and Andy."""
"Protest finally forced ""Amos and Andy"" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on."    Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
Negroes would be in an uproar.    So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.    Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.    Who are the other characters?
Who are the other characters?    Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?    "In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's ""The PJ's."""
"In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's ""The PJ's."""    Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.    I don't know about that plantation angle.
I don't know about that plantation angle.    What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!    We think so.
We think so.    Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?
"I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing ""Amos and Andy.""  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain."    To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.    I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.    You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?    I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.    Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?    Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.

What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?    "If Spielburg can direct ""The Color Purple"" and ""Amistad"", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot."
"If Spielburg can direct ""The Color Purple"" and ""Amistad"", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot."    That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?    No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!    Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.    Dunwitty, don't leave.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!    Calm down, please.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.    We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.    Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.    I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?    They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.    This has to be a big mistake.
This has to be a big mistake.    The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.    Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.    Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.    I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.    I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
What do you want?    I want to speak with you.
I want to speak with you.    Go away, unless you got my money.
Go away, unless you got my money.    It's me, Peerless.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.    It's been a long time.
It's been a long time.    Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.    Pleased to meet you.
Good woman.  I trained her right.    Daddy, she's younger than me.
Daddy, she's younger than me.    My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
Purely for medicinal purposes.    I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.    How did you end up here?
How did you end up here?    How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
That's what I'm askin'.    Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.    Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.    Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?    "All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the ""life's too short"" category."
Enough about me, what's happening with you?    The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?    Nuthin' I can't handle.
Nuthin' I can't handle.    The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.    Where do you go from here?
Where do you go from here?    Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.    I didn't mean that, in life.
I didn't mean that, in life.    In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
Let's get him over to the bed.    Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
I love you too, Daddy.    Always keep 'em laughing.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.    Is that so?
How long has my father been like this?    Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.    So he drank himself into a stuper?
So he drank himself into a stuper?    The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.    So what's up with you?
So what's up with you?    I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.    Your father is proud of you.
He never showed it.    He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
How was it?    Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?    Nobody told me anything.
Nobody told me anything.    What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?    It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Manray!    Manray!
How did you know?    It hit me like a ton of bricks.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.    How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.    The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Manray was under our nose the whole time.    Do you know how you will use him?
Do you know how you will use him?    Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
You lost me.    Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.    What point is that?
What point is that?    The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.    Sounds risky to me.
Sounds risky to me.    You getting cold feet?
You getting cold feet?    I'm in till the end.
I'm in till the end.    Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.    Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?    And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.    Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
Hello.    This is Cheeba.
You okay?    I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
What is your problem?    My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.    Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?    It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.    Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.    What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?    I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.    Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.    Hello.
Hello.    I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired.
This is the group I was telling you about.    Which one is your brother?
Which one is your brother?    The big one.
You've said that already.    I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
Just want to say good luck.    Break a leg.
Your life will never be the same.    Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.    We both lied to him.
We both lied to him.    What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?    Just don't lie to me.
Same here.    The pleasure is mine.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.    C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
Who's side are you on?    I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.    Everybody shut up.
So you have your small victory, now what?    A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
What is this?    A gift.
A gift.    For what?
For what?    No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.    This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.    Thanks.
Thanks.    I thought it was appropiate.
I thought it was appropiate.    Is that good or bad?
Is that good or bad?    It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.    How so?
How so?    To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
Why'd you do that?    I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.    How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?    You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.    That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.    He's just playing big brother.
He's just playing big brother.    Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?    Please don't go there.
Please don't go there.    Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.    I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.    Do you have to be so damn forthright?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.    Light?
Light?    That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.    You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
This is crazy.    That's why it will be so much fun.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.    The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.    Work related or otherwise?
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.    DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.    And that's how you got me in the first place.
Don't make me have to use this.    I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.    Give me the gun.
Yes, your name?    He, I'm Mona.
He, I'm Mona.    Hi, Mona.
Hi, Mona.    I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.

We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.    Oh, is that what I'm doing?
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.    David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.    "I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's ""LAUGH-IN."""
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.    Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.    I didn't mean it to sound like that.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?    Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.    The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
Can I kiss you too?    Naw.  I'll take the zero.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.    You feel good, not nervous?
You feel good, not nervous?    I feel fine.
I feel fine.    Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Not nervous?  Relaxed?    Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
So they can be on TV.    You sound like the media.
You sound like the media.    This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.    Same thing Giuliani said.
Same thing Giuliani said.    Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
No joke.  Serious.    Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.    In time.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?    No.
No.    You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?    Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?    Yeah.
Yeah.    And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.    What you did is dead wrong.
What you did is dead wrong.    Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.    Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.    Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.    I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.    Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.    My name is Manray, goddamnit.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.    Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.    It looks delicious.
It looks delicious.    You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.    C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.    I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
How's the food?    Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.    That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.    If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.    Mommy, please don't call me that.
Mommy, please don't call me that.    Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.    I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?    I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?    To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?    Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.    Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.    I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
Peerless, your father called.    I'll be right over.
He wants you to come and see him.    He said that?
He said that?    Yes he did.
Yes he did.    Where is he?
Where is he?    He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.    I can't go all the way down south.
Richmond is not all the way down south.    I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.    Regardless, he still is your father.
Regardless, he still is your father.    It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.    Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.    C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.    Peerless, last time, go see your father.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.    You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?    Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.    Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?    No.
No.    Not at all?
Not at all?    You know how your Daddy is.
You know how your Daddy is.    If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.    I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?    Soon.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?    I just turned twenty.
Where are you from?    Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.    Finland.
Finland.    You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?    Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?    What's a Negro.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.    Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!    Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?    Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.    Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
How did you get this gig?    My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?    This is a TV show, not a music video.
This is a TV show, not a music video.    Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?    This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.    Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.    First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.    The best defense is offense.
"The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, ""F"" 'em."    We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
Let Myrna finish.    Thank you.  And always smile.
Yes you!    This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
I never had a really real pair before.    You've never had any formal training, either?
You've never had any formal training, either?    Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.

So what's up with you and DeLa?    What do you mean?
What do you mean?    Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.    I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.    If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.    You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.    Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.    I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.    I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.    Tavis, thank you for having me.
Tavis, thank you for having me.    Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.

I'm more comfortable around my people.    Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?    "Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, ""it's all about the Benjamins."""
Money and nothing else?    Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.

Is it inevitable that the game plays you?    No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.

Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?    I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.

Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.    You tellin' the truth.

I fell out of my bed last night.    You slept too near where you got in?
You slept too near where you got in?    I slept too near where I fell out.
I slept too near where I fell out.    You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?    Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?    Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.

Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.    How be dat?
How be dat?    I don't know who I am.
I don't know who I am.    Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.    Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.    Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.

People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.    Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
A lot?    Enough.
So what's up with you?    What do you want to know?
What do you want to know?    The good stuff.
The good stuff.    I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.    What else?
What else?    Are you trying to rap to me?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.    Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.    Oh you do, huh?
Oh you do, huh?    Just a little something' somethin'.
Just a little something' somethin'.    I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.

No, before my time.    You don't read, do you?
You don't read, do you?    Never read a book in my whole life.

Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.    I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.    We can look out for ourselves.
Why don't you call him?    For what?  He left.  Not me.
You're sure this is a good idea.    My people love me.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.    Y'know what?
Y'know what?    What?
What?    You look beautiful like that.

Oh, you gonna make me say it.    Say what, Manray?
Say what, Manray?    Did you ever sleep with DeLa?

We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.    Aw, c'mon.
Aw, c'mon.    That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
"So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like ""IHOP.""  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass."    Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?

You can go now.    I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
Good day to you, young sir.    Good morning.
Good morning.    Where are you bound for?
Where are you bound for?    That is none of your business.
That is none of your business.    Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?    Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --    If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
Both of us ride home with Best here.    I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.    You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?    Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?    Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?    I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.    Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.    It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.    Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.    I never was more in earnest.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.    What is your uncle's name?
What is your uncle's name?    O'Grady.
O'Grady.    Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?    This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.    Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.    The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.    The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Where's the beauty you promised me?    It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.    I have acted as I think fit.
I have acted as I think fit.    Sir, I'm a British officer.
Sir, I'm a British officer.    It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?

Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?    Neither!
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.    How do you do, sir?
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.    Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.    What is the service, sir?
What is the service, sir?    There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?    Only a very little, as soldiers do.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.    I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?    I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Has he sent the challenge yet?    Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.    And his baggage?
And his baggage?    Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.    The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!    Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.    And so I am.
And so I am.    And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?    Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?    Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.    He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.    In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
Have you taken my message to him?    The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.    My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?    Your cousins go out with him.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.    It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.

If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.    I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.    Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.    I'll match any man with the sword.
I'll match any man with the sword.    But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.    Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.    It must have been some other gate.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.    A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.    I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.

I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.    Is Miss Dugan well?
Is Miss Dugan well?    There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.    Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?    She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.    Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!    No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.

The coward!    He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.    I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.    Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?    Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.    Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?    Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!    You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!

Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.    Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.    I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?    I don't know.

Where is my rascal, Lazlo?    I will let down the steps for your honor.
Good gracious!  What is this?    You are going to drive to the frontier.
You are going to drive to the frontier.    It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.

I have no luggage.    The gentleman has nothing contraband.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?    Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?    Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.    You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.

Who else can give me information about you?    Only the agency of servants.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.    I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?    I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.    We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.    Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.    I believe they will deport you.
I believe they will deport you.    I have faced that problem before.
I have faced that problem before.    But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?    Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.    But how, sir?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?    Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?    Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.    To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.

I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.    Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?    Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.

Then you yield to me.    On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.

Not even that.    How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?

Not one.    Have you not a man whom you value?

That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.    What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?    Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.    Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.    "Your word ""empty"" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it."
"Your word ""empty"" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it."    It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.    But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.    That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.    It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.

I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.    How so?
How so?    By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
You want my heart?    It is my only object.
It is my only object.    To make me wretched in two weeks.
To make me wretched in two weeks.    To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.    The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.

Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.    But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?    With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?    Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.    You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?    Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.    Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?    I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Will we always leave it at this?    Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.    I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.    Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.    Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.    My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.    Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.    O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.    Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.    As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.    "We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  ""Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"""
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:    Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.    Old fool!
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.    Agreed.
Agreed.    Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
I feel the ribbon.    Then you must get it.
Why are you shaking?    With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.    I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.    Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?    I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?    But you refused me, Dorothy.
But you refused me, Dorothy.    Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.    If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.    But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.    I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.    What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?    Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.    Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?    Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?    As much as possible.
As much as possible.    As much as possible?
As much as possible?    Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.    All the same, you must name an amount.
All the same, you must name an amount.    It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.    All right, five hundred guineas.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.    Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?    By name only.
By name only.    Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?    Yes!
Yes!    Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
Does this assignment interest you?    Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Was he cheated?    In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.    Hmm-mmmm.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.    The Prince left him only that choice.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.    When is he to go?
Then this must be done tomorrow.    What is to be done?
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?    "Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him ""good luck."""
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?    Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.    I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.    But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?    O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?    That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.    You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.    Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.    Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.

I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.    There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.

Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?    May I be quite frank with you?
May I be quite frank with you?    Yes, of course.
Yes, of course.    Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.

I see.
I see.    When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
Did you buy the horse, papa?    Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.    But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?    Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good night, papa.    Good night, my little darling.
Good night, my little darling.    Papa?
Papa?    Yes?
Yes?    One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?    What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.    Yes, papa.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.    Is he all right, papa?
Is he all right, papa?    Yes, he's fine.
Yes, he's fine.    Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.    Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.    Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Would you have me spend my life all alone?    In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.    The milkmaid's daughter?
The milkmaid's daughter?    Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.    Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?    I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?    Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.    I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?    Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?    He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?    Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?

Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?    I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?    Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.    Sir, let those laugh that win.
Sir, let those laugh that win.    I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Charming Schuvaloff.    Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.    Dark Valdez.
Dark Valdez.    Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?    Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.    And he doesn't care about me?
And he doesn't care about me?    He is only curious to know who you are.
He is only curious to know who you are.    If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.    He loves me, as I love you.
He loves me, as I love you.    Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Will he wish to know the details of this night?    He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.    Tender Hegenheim.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.    You know that was like a quadruple negative?
Can I at least have a drink?    It's ten thirty in the morning.
It's ten thirty in the morning.    Yeah, if you've slept.
Yeah, if you've slept.    You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.    "Don't you mean ""don't need no liquor license not taken away from me""?"
Hurricane kept you up, too?    Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
Bill Styles...    Who?
Who?    Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!    I'm -- I'm sorry...
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?    I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.    Just safety your shit and get behind me, okay? I'll take care of this.
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --    What do we do?
What do we do?    Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
I don't want to go --    Fine.
Did -- did you --    It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
What about Pike?    Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
He is the only one unaccounted for.    Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
You framed-him...    None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --    Can anybody hear me!
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?    We found him like this --
You killed him you fucking faggot --    We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
We got -- I don't know, we got separated    Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --    I don't know!
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.    HEY!
West was one thing, but this --    Shut up, Mueller.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?    We don't know. West is dead.
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --    What do you mean, alone?
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?    We found him like this...
Yeah, right...    Shut up.  West's dead.
You too?    We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
Why not?    I asked for a policeman.
I asked for a policeman.    You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?    It's... too slow.
It's... too slow.    Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.    I just don't like it.
I just don't like it.    What do you like then?
I don't know... I like the Army.    C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.    You did Basic here?
You did Basic here?    Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
There's no need...    They're dead, aren't they?
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?    Okay.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?    I'm not telling you what happened.
I'm not telling you what happened.    Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
Some.    Tell me about them.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?    Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
You smoke, Ray?    This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.    No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!    That son of a bitch.
That son of a bitch.    That'd be my reaction too --
That'd be my reaction too --    He's lying.
He's lying.    Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --    I'm serious --
"Fuck ""you're serious"", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it."    Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --    I didn't shoot West --
I didn't shoot West --    Yeah, we know, Pike did.
I apologize --    You saw West's body.
You saw West's body.    Of course --
And he'd been shot.    Yeah --
You shot Childs and Nunez.    They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.    You saved Kendall's life --
You saved Kendall's life --    But not Pike's.
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --    Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
We're not finished yet --    You wanna bet?
We don't need the tapes --    Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?    We've found all of them.
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --    Jesus!
He -- He made me do it --    Do what?
Do what?    Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.    And the bodies?
And the bodies?    You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...    "Washout rejects, guys he said were ""dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead""..."
"Washout rejects, guys he said were ""dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead""..."    He's telling the truth up to a point...
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?    No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.    Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.    There were six of us...
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?    Epilepsy.
Epilepsy.    Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
He said he worked there --    No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?    What business?
What business?    Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Where?    The creek bed --
What about the phosphorous grenade?    One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
Back up.    Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Mueller was alone in the cabin?    Yeah.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?    Would you have believed me?
Where's the cabin?    Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.    Can't do that now, though, can you?
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.    We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --    Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...    How do you know that?
How do you know that?    Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Cadet, what's your name!    Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, Dunbar, sir!    You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?    Sir, yes, sir!
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?    Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!    The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
What the fuck is going on?    Your weapons, Sergeant.
He wouldn't kill anybody...    Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --    I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.    Why?
Why?    We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Jesus, what happened?    West... he's dead.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.    So did we. Why didn't you come?
So you killed him?    I...
Whose blood is that, Jay?    West's. Any kindling for afire?
What do you mean, West's?    I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Where have you been, Jay?    Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Roberto, what the fuck?    We just want to check your pack --
We just want to check your pack --    Why?
You know it's not like that --    Do I?
Right?    Yeah...
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.    You hated West more than any of us.
You hated West more than any of us.    Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --    You're the only one missing a grenade.
You're the only one missing a grenade.    Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.    If not you, then who?
If not you, then who?    Mueller.
Mueller.    Oh, come on --
Oh, come on --    We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --    That's exactly what he says about you.
That's exactly what he says about you.    Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
You hated West, Mueller loved him --    Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --    Bullshit.
Bullshit.    Look in my pack.
Look in my pack.    Why?
Why?    Just look. Little pocket.
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.    You're lying --
You're lying --    Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
Why... why didn't you tell me?    Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.    You saw West, right? How was he killed?
You saw West, right? How was he killed?    Full clip to the body --
Full clip to the body --    From up close or far away?
From up close or far away?    His chest was hamburger --
His chest was hamburger --    That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...    They?
They?    Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
I... I don't know...    What don't you know?
What don't you know?    This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --    No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --    We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --    Put it down!
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?    Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --    Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.    But not the only victim, right?
But not the only victim, right?    My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.    Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.    He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?    "I think you just blew ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" out of the fucking water."
"I think you just blew ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" out of the fucking water."    The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
"Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called ""motive"" and you just gave yourself one."    You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.    "What happened to ""degrees""?"
"What happened to ""degrees""?"    I didn't kill him --
I didn't kill him --    Then who did?
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.    But you didn't.
But you didn't.    No. Poetic justice, though.
He admitted it.    Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
Why did he come back for you?    I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.    Mr. Hardy?
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --    Stop.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --    How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.    Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.    My heart weeps.
Is it the truth?    There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --    So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --    Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.    No. I said Dunbar.
No. I said Dunbar.    "Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said ""Dunbar was gone,"" My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie."
"I believe your next line is ""What are you trying to hide?"""    Well?
Well?    Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
Dunbar will testify that you were.    Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
Something funny, Levi?    I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --    I didn't do anything --
Why?    Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
How do you know?    Because I was standing next to him.
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?    I didn't --
I didn't --    But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!    I don't know --
I don't know --    Where are they!
Where are they!    Maybe --
Maybe --    MAYBE WHAT --
MAYBE WHAT --    Maybe he...
How are you?    Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --    What kind of trouble are you in?
That bad?    Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --    Tell me what I can do.
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.    And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
"The official term for it is ""Clusterfuck"". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant..."    It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.    Well, he's a good soldier.
"The exercise was one of his Section Eight ""private sessions"". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning."    And the problem is you only got three.
And the problem is you only got three.    No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.    I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?    Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?    The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.    And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --    I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --    He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.    Who killed Pike?
Who killed Pike?    Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.    There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.    Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.    Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --    Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.    From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.    Nevertheless --
Nevertheless --    Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.    Not for me.
You mean not enough to save you.    JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Tom, where are you going --    Home, I'm done.
Home, I'm done.    What about the confession?
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --    What the hell are you talking about --
What the hell are you talking about --    I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
What I said before --    Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?    Yeah.
Yeah.    Does Osborne agree?
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.    That's horseshit and you know it.
That's horseshit and you know it.    Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
You think you could explain all this to me?    I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
They're taking your command, aren't they?    The Senator...
I'm sorry, Bill.    Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.    You're a good soldier, Bill.
You're a good soldier, Bill.    I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?    What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?    If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.    You're drunk --
You're drunk --    I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
Stay where you are.    Or what? You've gone round the bend --
Or what? You've gone round the bend --    West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.    That's preposterous --
That's preposterous --    Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.

I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.    I wanted to see if he was okay --
I wanted to see if he was okay --    You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.    I'm not even going to dignify that --
I'm not even going to dignify that --    No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --    You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.

There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.    Not for long.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.    You're crazy --
You're crazy --    You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.    For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --    Get your hands away from the desk!
Hostile and uncooperative.    Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
Ah, Christ    You knew Sergeant West?
You knew Sergeant West?    He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.    Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.    And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --    You and the Colonel go back.
